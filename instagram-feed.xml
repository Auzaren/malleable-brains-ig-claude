Jets flying overhead. Lunatics banging pots and pans. Masked joggers, masked pizza men, masked dogs awaiting testing; everyone in the park wearing masks; no one masked in a crowd of 30 watching the armored van roll over the discarded grass clippings. A woman beaten by a police officer (off duty, of course) for refusing to wear a mask in a warehouse store. A man spits in the face of a clerk. Alcohol sales increasing by 70 percent or more, and legal dope available for curbside pickup. Standoffs, the stockpiling of weapons, protests and counter-protests with assault rifles in state capitols. The hospitals not overwhelmed but empty and staff let go. Yellow murder tape across merry-go-rounds. Children, neighbors objects of medium-level suspicion at best. Technology not a stopgap or a substitute but a condition for a new conception of bare life. Packages on doorsteps, dropped by unseen and poorly remunerated agents of the world&apos;s richest man. Children raped on camera. Domestic assault. A hundred thousand defaults piling up in the portfolio of a single regional bank. Suicide. The end of education. The end of employment. Prophets, of course, everywhere.<br/><br/>Numbers will be sought to explain the world around us. What does it mean to say that the present crisis is somehow twice as bad as that of 2008, that a fifth of the country is out of work, that the only industry now hiring is debt collection? <br/><br/>Was all of this inevitable? Is it now? It is always possible to insist that we should seek another way, a path of shared work, shared purpose, and shared wealth, as our great-grandparents did long ago. <br/><br/>But this is naive. <br/>_____<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

The bar looked newly renovated, maybe the post-Sandy insurance covered the imported Swedish floors. The bar was called the Whales Tale. <br/>I was a terrible conversationalist that night. All I thought about was eyes and whales. Melville wrote in Moby Dick, &quot;For what is it that makes the front of a man-- what, indeed, but his eyes?&quot; Okay, sure. But what do whale eyes look like? So I looked it up, dead smack in the middle of a whirlpool on the dancefloor which kept dragging me deeper into an abyss of uncoordinated side-stepping. (&quot;A whale sees in monochrome and has one eye on each side of its head.&quot;) Soon after, on the bathroom line pacing with excretive excitement as the thought of seeing fluids all over the toilet seat disgusted me, I finally understood that I was fighting a losing battle. The plethora of characters, events, dates, and the infinite branching of cause and effect in my life has strained my emotional capacity to love my neighbors. I find myself banging my head against the wall of history and looking up and seeing, growing all over the world - ever higher and denser like creeping ivy, the total descent into meaninglessness. At this point, I was spinning. It&apos;s hard to stay sober in an environment where everybody hates everybody way deep down. Where does this hatred come from? Lust? Then I saw the blue-eyed chick. <br/>She was bobbing drunkenly side-to-side between three burned pieces of toast showered in cologne who I, unfortunately, need to still call human beings although they were the bastard children of consumerism. They reminded me of Ed, Edd, and Eddy if it took place in Howard Beach.<br/><br/>She had her phone in her hand the whole time, and anyone who dances with their phone in their hand does not actually want to be there. What she really wanted was a break from yet after another day in a seemingly futureless life. But bars did not make it this long by being beacons of introspection. <br/>_______<br/><br/>The rest of the story is in the comment section!<br/><br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

But they came out anyway. Two of the finest legs Western Civilization could produce, all wrapped up in a hot-pink sweat factory skirt, approached a young boy. A whiff of Hani Mori consumed his nostrils and he thought he was mature to realize “that” was a woman: legs, perfume, and a distraction from reality. Up until this moment, the only olfactory sensation with equal power had been mom&apos;s chocolate chip cookies. <br/>The pink-haired, non-gendered NYU student holding up a sign which read “We demand justice!” once heard a feminist semiologist deliver a talk on the synecdoche of the chocolate chip cookie. Cautious not to attach a gendered dimension to the raw ball of sugar, the semiologist declared that chocolate chip cookies must be understood as a heuristic of patriarchy, a ploy and satire of femininity only a pig like Bukowski could imagine. The oven is a harem, a simulacrum of a brothel where these raw balls of artificial social constructions are transfigured like the Eucharist into a product of capitalism where the natural, rawest roots of all matter become manicured into archetypes imbued with domesticity and male lust which fuels the imperialist U.S. military-industrial complex. In short, the wife should not engage in next Fall&apos;s bake sale. <br/>He coughed a bit as the woman passed and he imagined that he coughed like his brother does when he smokes his Spirits in the backyard and tells him to keep quiet about it. His dad looked down at him and saw where his son&apos;s attention was. Finding a profoundly evolutionary comfort in knowing the family lineage of masculinity is in good hands, he patted him on the shoulder and grinned. <br/>The frizzy-haired lady next to them saw this whole encounter unfold. She would have scoffed aloud but her eyes said it all. Hand on hip and mouth slightly agape, she likened the father&apos;s juvenile approval of his son&apos;s pubescent sexual curiosity to her ex-husband. Last she heard, he was holding hands with a blondie down in South Beach with too many buttons undone. She always told him to button-up, since it looked uncouth and mafioso. No wonder he left.<br/>_______<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

This, in turn, has sparked renewed interest in the notion of ‘virtual museums’, and one name that crops up frequently in this context is the 20th Century French writer and politician André Malraux, inventor of the term musée imaginaire – usually translated as the ‘museum without walls’, or the ‘imaginary museum.’ What I have gathered from Malraux’s writings is that the museum is the product of the globalized, secular West. Malraux sought for a way to synthesize the individual, who in his mind was (and still is) increasingly conceived of as an amalgam of social constructions, to a unity in world culture not rooted in the Christian Absolute (e.g., Steve Bannon’s Judeo-Christian Civilization). In typical post-war French existentialist fashion, he thought humans possessed a mechanism to self-create meaning which negates the nothingness of the self by possessing images and ideas of meaning. <br/>Because the modern age has lost a sense of a human orientation to the Absolute, the transcendent is now a wholly negative idea to people who believe humans create their purpose. The results appear to be spiritual suffering and a trailing obsession to fill this existential void. Art, Malraux claims, is the dominant form of action in response to this transcendent absence. Humans seek to triumph over death by the power of creation. <br/>So, what do the museums make of this modern condition? They open their doors to all, showcasing the works of artists who once believed all art was a testament to transcendent religious goals and other artists who see art as Malraux did. Art is the individual’s fight against tradition, with imposed hierarchies, with unwavering beliefs, with closed-door institutions, and, penultimately, death. <br/>Museums are the churches we used to attend. Where we worshiped, prayed, and suffered alongside strangers who we called our brothers and sisters. Now, we attend these new churches as intellectual invitees, hoping to establish a connection with art removed of all context and transcendent meaning. Just like us. <br/>________<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Others see Google  Deepmind&apos;s AlphaGo dethroning the world&apos;s best Go player. Some imagine Schwarzenegger&apos;s Terminator. Watson and AlphaGo are examples of narrow super-intelligence, possessing capabilities superior to the most capable humans, but only in an limited domain, thus posing no danger to us. The Terminator, albeit entertaining, is good old-fashioned Hollywood sensationalism. Consequently, it is difficult to marshal an appropriate emotional response to the dangers posed by AI that is both super-intelligent, and possesses the cross-domain abilities that human-level ‘general intelligence’ allows.<br/><br/>Nick Bostrom, director of The Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University, and author of “Superintelligence,” argues that, by the turn of the century, it is likely that we will develop some form of AI that surpasses humans in &apos;general intelligence&apos; (the ability to perform any task as well as any adult human). As a result, the spectrum of intelligence will extend far beyond what is achievable by the human brain. By the nature of physics, electronic circuits operate 1,000,000 times faster than biochemical ones. This means that an AI with ‘general intelligence’ no greater than that of any current human, could perform 20,000 years of intellectual work in the matter of one week. One can see how powerful a technology like this would be, whether we would be able to maintain control over it or not. This is not to say that existential catastrophe is the default outcome, but it is paramount that we proceed with caution.<br/><br/>This technology seems so foreign, so sci-fi, so far in the future, that the concerned cries of the few fall on deaf ears. Yet, the frontier of super-intelligence is here; now is the time to make sure it is something we can live with.<br/>___________<br/><br/>The author and art accompanying this post, &quot;Artificial Intelligence&quot;, @tristan.votta @votta.art.

Agostino, a coddled and chaste 13-year-old, adores his widowed mother and her “beloved body” with the shamelessness of a child who has just begun to recognize people as sexual beings. His reverence towards his mother is shaken when a young, charming boatman joins them on their daily ”patino” (Italian: bathing raft) rides out to sea. To quiet the rampant thoughts about his mother and this novel male archetype, Agostino deliberately embarks on a journey of adolescent freedom with a group of poor neighborhood boys who have an appetite for debauchery, nicotine, and adult acceptance. <br/>____________<br/><br/>Adolescence—with its mood swings and blindsiding first loves—is a period of hyper-feeling without catharsis or reprieve. Many of Moravia’s protagonists, young and old, share this adolescent quality, trying relentlessly to understand what they cannot. Moravia creates this discordance on the page, and it is just enthralling. <br/>I am no longer the young son of a single mother, but I know those Moravian moments of adolescent intrigue driven by the transformation of filial love into sensual appetite all too well. This discord is the debonding all mothers curse and what all boys fight for. <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

This was my unlikely companion aboard a 12:15 p.m. train from New York City to Poughkeepsie. His name was Jacoby.<br/><br/>We spoke of worldly affairs, far removed and too esoteric for the woman next to me scribbling away at her Sudoku and the kid a few rows up whose foot bobbed up-and-down ferociously as he sipped his iced coffee. <br/>He was a psychoanalyst for most of his adult life. I appreciated how he explained things as if I was his grandson. His advice was told through mediums of story and photography. Psychoanalysis met the need for emotional adjustment resulting from accelerated social change at the turn of the twentieth century. Jacoby was captivated by the depths of the human mind, especially during his walks through Washington Square Park with Alvin Toffler during his undergraduate years at NYU.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It was the Depression, two world wars, and the Cold War that bulked up Uncle Sam. Once bulked up, Uncle Sam never shrunk. <br/>Uncle Sam is said to be our guardian from the state of nature, which Hobbes famously described in Leviathan as “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.” He continued: During the time men live without a common power to keep them in awe, they are in that condition which is called war; and stuck a war, as is of every man, against every man.” The state is the conqueror of nature, the greatest domesticator. <br/>How will the state grow after the coronavirus? Only time will tell, but what I do know is that the state will continue its crusade against the “shortness” of nature; in other words, death. <br/>As a society grows richer, so does its appetite for life. Death in the West is a technical failure, not an end to a metaphysical journey. Every cause of death is curable, if only we listen to the scientists more. So they say. <br/>The effect of this unprecedented, global moment will be Uncle Sam’s crusade against death. The state will try to monitor our movements, both public and private. The state will monitor virus chatter just as intelligence agencies monitor chatter for terrorist activity. The state will do almost anything for the sake of the preservation of life, and we will accept it. <br/>We will accept it because once we emerge all bleary-eyed from the isolation wards we once called our homes, we will feel a deep unease that “they” did not keep us safe. A new populism is brewing, a populism for life above all else, no matter the costs. <br/>Uncle Sam is taking notes. <br/>___________<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Of all the persons killed or harmed in some way by the World Trade Center bomb, you cannot name one who was against you or your cause. You did not care, just so long as you left dead bodies and people hurt.<br/><br/>Ramzi Yousef, you are not fit to uphold Islam. Your God is death. Your God is not Allah ... You weren&apos;t seeking conversions. The only thing you wanted to do was to cause death. Your God is not Allah. You worship death and destruction. What you do, you do not for Allah; you do it only to satisfy your own twisted sense of ego.<br/><br/>You would have others believe that you are a soldier, but the attacks on civilization for which you stand convicted here were sneak attacks which sought to kill and maim totally innocent people ... You, Ramzi Yousef, came to this country pretending to be an Islamic fundamentalist, but you cared little or nothing for Islam or the faith of the Muslims. Rather, you adored not Allah, but the evil that you yourself have become. And I must say that as an apostle of evil, you have been most effective.” Judge Duffy, a Catholic, a graduate of Fordham Law, a father, and an esteemed judge, passed away on Wednesday from the coronavirus. <br/>Stay healthy everyone. You are all on our minds. <br/>______________<br/>@joe_delvicario <br/>@sagegibbons <br/>@matthewzehnbauer</p>]]></content:encoded>

There was something Biblical about our talks. Two imperfect humans pleading for our sins to be absolved. You once told me only children and fools tell the truth. But you never told me why. You once told me that originality is unintentional, and probably regrettable. But you never told me why.<br/><br/>I went to the pond today where we always spoke. I saw a woman with surgical gloves and a cigarette between her fingers. I thought it was such a strange combination of precaution and nonchalance. But if you were there, you would have pointed out that sex is also a strange combination of precaution and nonchalance. Your facetiousness is missed. Facetiousness is mistaken for uncouth immaturity. But truth is revealed in what we are told not to laugh at. <br/>A newborn in his mother’s arms stared at the pond. I remembered how you once described me when I was a newborn. Dirty, but marvelous. Infinite in possibility, capable of the miracle of growth. This bundle of delicate porcelain and biological perfection will come to know love, anxiety, prayer, suffering, metaphysics, and death. Trapped in the womb for months, the newborn is compelled to breath but it hurts. Compelled to see light, but it blinds. Compelled to hear noise, but it terrifies. A newborn learns that nature is adversarial and the mother is nurturing and mitigating. The gulf between the pond and his mother’s arms is his unconscious training of this axiom. <br/>You are old, retired from this world of theatrics. Now you are afloat in the world of geriatrics. Every old man is a confession, a revelation of truth. You were was once a madman. Your wrinkles show a life of effort trying to unite yourself to the world.<br/><br/>I miss our talks, the only time we confessed and concealed truth for the sake of unity. <br/>__________________<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Today, that would be worth an estimated $550 million dollars.<br/><br/>The tragedy is assumed to have played a role in the US financial panic of 1857,  which resulted from a declining international economy and an over expansion of the domestic economy.<br/><br/>Over a century later the ship and its gold were located by a now very rich team who made use of Bayesian probability.<br/><br/>Bayesian probability is an interpretation of the concept of probability that changed the world, and in upcoming posts I’m going to lay out what makes it so useful, and how to incorporate it into the way you see the world.

A Ruthenian is a member of the Byzantine Catholic Church whose origins lie in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire and are now in modern-day Ukraine. <br/>At Warhol’s funeral, John Richardson delivered a eulogy for his life-long friend and spoke of Warhol’s “secret piety”, which “inevitably changes our perception of an artist who fooled the world into believing his only obsessions were money, fame, and glamour, and that he was cool to the point of callousness. Never take Andy at face value.” There’s much literature out there for you to find on Warhol’s secret piety, such as the fact that he nearly always carried a rosary and small missal in his pocket and he put his nephew through the seminary. <br/>What I hope to leave you with is a fresh perspective on who Warhol was and what he aimed to achieve with his art. Warhol was surely influenced by Schluckbildchen, which means “devotional pictures for swallowing.” These small notes of paper had sacred images on them with the purpose of being swallowed since it was believed that the papers possessed curative powers.<br/><br/>Warhol portrayed twentieth-century society’s hunger for new curative powers based on socially accepted norms of artificial meaning. Celebrities and media entertainment became our priests and dogma. Consumerism supplanted all tradition, all authority. The deeply religious nature of Warhol’s art is neither well-known nor widely accepted as an accurate interpretation of his life’s work. <br/>Warhol, only once, betrayed his “secret piety”, so to speak. In the final image, we see him with Pope John Paul II. For once, he looks like a person, not a symbol or a caricature but a Ruthenian. <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

It makes more sense to say that the Lamborghini has a radio, just the way it has tires or a transmission.<br/><br/>@ericrweinstein conjectures that we make this error when talking about workers. <br/>For example we say that someone IS a doctor, or a dishwasher... and instead, what we need to do as the value of human labor decreases, is to readjust our model of an economic agent from an “is a” to “has a” model.<br/><br/>The idea being that you, (like the Lamborghini) may have a radio, but you are not a radio. And that when radios become obsolete, the identity of the Lamborghini is not harmed...The economic translation being that you may consist of a breadwinner, a contributor, and a consumer, so that when the breadwinner part of your identity is rendered obsolete by A.I., you still have your identity, and with it, a meaningful life in the next stage of a 21st or 22nd century economy.

A three-time All-Star, he had a career batting average of .293 and was two years removed from batting .335. On Oct. 7, 1969, he and Tim McCarver were traded to Philadelphia as part of an eight-player deal that also included Dick Allen.<br/><br/>Flood refused to go. <br/>What’s been called the MLB’s “Declaration of Independence,” Flood’s rejection letter began by stating: “After twelve years in the Major Leagues, I do not feel that I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes.” Flood’s rejection of a trade to the Phillies ignited the labor relations revolution that cost him his career. Between addressing commissioner Bowie Kuhn and signing his name, in an economical 127 words, Flood launched what would help create the billion-dollar free agency market that dominates not only baseball but seemingly all professional sports.<br/><br/>Flood’s letter challenged the then-authoritative reserve clause which, in North American professional sports, was part of a player’s contract which stated the rights to players were retained by the team upon the contract&apos;s expiration. Players under these contracts were not free to enter into another contract with another team. Once signed to a contract, players could, at the team&apos;s whim, be reassigned, traded, sold, or released. In 1975, after much-heated litigation, Flood and other players who brought suits against their parent organizations prevailed and the reserve clause was abolished in favor of free agency. <br/>At last week’s news conference to introduce himself and his record $324 million contract with the Yankees, Gerrit Cole named-dropped Flood. “Challenging the reserve clause was essential to the blossoming sport we have today,” Cole said, later explaining to New York reporters how a teammate would challenge players to know their history. “I hope everyone has that conversation about Curt Flood on the bus. <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Therefore, they are fond of this more than the work is of its maker. A cause of this is that to exist is for all people something choiceworthy and lovable, and we exist by means of activity (for this consists in living and acting). And in his activity, the maker of something somehow ‘is’ the work; he therefore feels affection for the work because he feels affection also for his own existence.” ___________<br/><br/>@sagegibbons, @matthewzehnbauer, and I have taken noticeable time away from the page to focus on achieving our academic/career goals.

I have my law school finals throughout December, so I will be busy finishing up my semester and will therefore not be on the page until the holidays come around. <br/>Remember that the time and value you put in your work is essentially adding value in yourself. <br/>Until next time, <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

What have you all been reading lately? I’ve been consumed by my assigned readings for law school, but I still make time for leisure reading. <br/>________<br/><br/>Today, I’m rereading an interview with Michel Houellebecq in the Fall 2010 issue of the @parisreview. Here’s a Houellebecquian writing tip: <br/>Interviewer: “How do you have the nerve to write some of the things you do?” Michel: “Oh, it’s easy. I just pretend that I’m already dead.” ________<br/><br/>Outside of my school work, I’ve been rotating Thomas Bernhard’s The Loser, the recently published Sopranos Sessions, and some of Stephen Dobyn’s poetry. <br/>The last book I finished was Days of Wrath by André Malraux (4/5). I’ve read some great articles too, reach out if you want some recommendations! <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Then there was the time he was accused of sodomy with a male as a young man. Maybe the humiliation he felt in the public showing of the 16th-century penal system scarred him indefinitely until his death. Perhaps he chose the men to serve not only as pristine models of the male form for his art but his plutonic way to both hide and live out his homosexual psychical development as Freud claimed. Wouldn&apos;t you be as prudent as possible with your sex life if you were accused of a crime that at the time carried prison sentences and death in some circumstances? <br/>In Part II, we have the sketch of Leonardo’s closest pupil, Salai, with his hand gestured towards the sky which was a common artistic device in the Renaissance to symbolize a higher implicit ideal. Then, we have the erect penis also pointing upwards. Can we interpret this sketch as da Vinci’s acceptance of his homosexuality and a declaration of the natural beauty and truth of human sexuality in the age of humanism? <br/>We definitely can, and we definitely should.</p>]]></content:encoded>

What the phantasy conceals is merely a reminiscence of sucking— or being suckled—at his mother’s breast, a scene of human beauty that he, like so many artists, undertook to depict with his brush, in the guise of the mother of God and her child.&quot; So how do we go from active to passive sucking?<br/><br/>Freud continues on page 48: &quot;The child’s love for his mother cannot continue to develop consciously any further; it succumbs to repression. The boy represses his love for his mother: he puts himself in her place, identifies himself with her, and takes his own person as a model in whose likeness he chooses the new objects of his love. In this way he has become a homosexual. What he has in fact done is to slip back to auto-erotism: for the boys whom he now loves as he grows up are after all only substitutive figures and revivals of himself in childhood—boys whom he loves in the way in which his mother loved him when he was a child. He finds the objects of his love along the path of narcissism, as we say; for Narcissus, according to the Greek legend, was a youth who preferred his own reflection to everything else and who was changed into the lovely flower of that name. […] By repressing his love for his mother he preserves it in his unconscious and from now on remains faithful to her. While he seems to pursue boys and to be their lover, he is in reality running away from the other women, who might cause him to be unfaithful.&quot; Freud concludes that we cannot expect to find in Leonardo anything more than traces of untransformed sexual inclination. But, to take a firm stance, Freud followed that these traces &quot;pointed in one direction and moreover allow him to be reckoned as a homosexual (p. 50).&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Strangely, this phantasy is so completely passive in character; moreover it resembles certain dreams and phantasies found in women or passive homosexuals (who played the part of the woman in sexual relations. […] The inclination to take a man’s sexual organ into the mouth and suck at it, which in respectable society is considered a loathsome sexual perversion, is nevertheless found with great frequency among women of to-day—and of earlier times as well, as ancient sculptures show—, and in the state of being in love it appears completely to lose its repulsive character (p. 33-34).&quot; &quot;Further investigation informs us that this situation, which morality condemns with such severity, may be traced to an origin of the most innocent kind. It only repeats in a different form a situation in which we all once felt comfortable— when we were still in our suckling days and took our mother’s nipple into our mouth and sucked at it. The organic impression of this experience—the first source of pleasure in our life—doubtless remains indelibly printed on us; and when at a later date the child becomes familiar with the cow’s udder whose function is that of a nipple, but whose shape and position under the belly make it resemble a penis, the preliminary stage has been reached which will later enable him to form the repellent sexual fantasy (Ibid).&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here, the libido evades the fate of repression by being sublimated from the very beginning into curiosity and by becoming attached to the powerful instinct for research as a reinforcement. With second types, intellectual development may be able to resist repression, but natural investigation often manifests in sexual activity.<br/><br/>Freud asserts on the next page, with a justifiable element of hesitation: &quot;The core of his nature, and the secret of it, would appear to be that after his curiosity had been activated in infancy in the service of sexual interests he succeeded in sublimating the greater part of his libido into an urge for research.&quot; Freud bases his defense of his assertion on an interpretation of a recurring early childhood memory of da Vinci. Da Vinci described the vulture memory as follows: &quot;It seems that I was always destined to be so deeply concerned with vultures; for I recall as one of my very earliest memories that while I was in my cradle a vulture came down to me, and opened my mouth with its tail, and struck me many times with its tail against my lips.&quot; Freud considered the negligent disregard of this childhood vignette by biographers over the centuries an egregious injustice akin to rejecting &quot;the body of legends, traditions and interpretations found in a nation’s early history.&quot; I love this last note. History is a recurring dream in constant interpretation. Whatever we think happened in our past, no matter how fuzzy or close to the truth our recollection is,  are priceless pieces of evidence of individual mental development, just like nations.<br/><br/>Freud’s interpretation: &quot;If we examine with the eyes of a psycho-analyst Leonardo’s phantasy of the vulture, it does not appear strange for long. We seem to recall having come across the same sort of thing in many places, for example in dreams; so that we may venture to translate the phantasy from its own special language into words that are generally understood. The translation is then seen to point to an erotic content.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

The charge ended in an acquittal.<br/><br/>Three centuries later, Sigmund Freud took it upon himself to explore the deeply personal and, some might say, scandalous history of da Vinci&apos;s homosexuality. The result we now have of Freud&apos;s unique psychoanalytic inquiry is his 1910 work, Leonardo da Vinci: A Memory of His Childhood.<br/><br/>Freud devotes particular attention to a beautiful aphorism said to be uttered by da Vinci: &quot;Nessuna cosa si può amare nè odiare, se prima non si ha cognition di quella&quot; (Nothing you can love nor hate, if before you have no cognition of that). His word&apos;s surely inspired action, as attested by his voluminous manuscripts on science and the blossoming humanist philosophies of his time, his inventions, and of course, his paintings. But for a man with such an enviable dual nature as scientific investigator and artist, why did he barely investigate his sexuality? Da Vinci never married, and no sexual relations with women have surfaced in the centuries of biographies on his life. <br/>Why is this?<br/><br/>On page 22, Freud states: &quot;Leonardo teaches us how many other things we have to take into account in connection with these [sexual conversion] processes. The postponement of loving until full knowledge is acquired ends in a substitution of the latter for the former. […] He has investigated instead of loving. And that is perhaps why Leonardo’s life was so much poorer in love than that of other great men, and of other artists. The stormy passions of a nature that inspires and consumes, passions in which other men have enjoyed their richest experience, appear not to have touched him.&quot; He follows: ”If we reflect on the concurrence in Leonardo of his over powerful instinct for research and the atrophy of his sexual life (which was restricted to what is called ideal [sublimated] homosexuality) we shall be disposed to claim him as a model instance of our third type.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

In typical fashion, I only became aware of him as a result of this.<br/><br/>I thus share his work with you not in the way of a curator, but in the way that one might pridefully whisper to a stranger the admiration one has for a close friend as you both stand watching them do their life’s work right there in front of you. <br/>Upon scrolling through a pdf of Robert Frank’s “The Americans” (the 21st century is here to stay), I felt an immediate affinity to the back-alley scenes he presented me. <br/>It feels like something I know. It feels like the texture of a mythology so often scrubbed smooth. I want to be there with him, snapping the shutter closed on my Leica camera of whatever and whoever. Road-tripping across the country in 1955. Can you imagine? Can any of us?<br/><br/>There is such a potency in his sight, I feel like I haven’t been using my eyes correctly. It evokes the sudden possibility of going out, finding and focusing on a moment of undeniable, beautiful reality, and like Robert Frank, taking the shot. ( @sagegibbons )</p>]]></content:encoded>

History has not proven otherwise. While the Lincoln Memorial was being built, it’s unlikely the architects and sculptors imagined the site would become a tourist site of the Ancient American civilization. <br/>In 1889, John A. Mitchell imagined such a fate for his beloved nation in the novel, The Last American. <br/>The story begins in 2951 aboard Persian captain Khan-Li’s exploration vessel. Khan was inspired to set sail and find the land of Mehrika (America) after reading the classic, “History of the Mehrikans.” In 1990, the Mehrikan civilization ceased to exist due to the disastrous effects of climate change and greed (😅). The book progresses energetically towards a very bleak ending (I won’t spoil it!). The Last American is an absolute treasure. I consider it the most cherished book on my bookshelf. I love the funny names of the Persians: Prince of Dimph-Yoo-Chur (Dim Future), Fattan-laiz-eh (Fat and Lazy), and Ja-Khaz (Jack Ass). I love the etchings of America in ruins. The etchings depict the entropy that currently exists as the shadow of all progress. The innovation we will create and experience in our lifetime will one day be a footnote in the long list of humanity’s achievements. Widely cited, but forever a memory. <br/>Mitchell included a scene where the explorers decide a wooden Native American figure holding tobacco was the Mehrikan’s God. This exchange critiqued the 19th-century excavation craze that took place in Europe and America and our flawed omniscience of the past. This scene only furthers my point. <br/>Our civilization will be interpreted, dissected, critiqued, laughed at, reified, reimagined, and then, just like Mitchell and his fantasy novel, forgotten. <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

For the first time, the public could access money 24 hours a day, seven days a week. <br/>This ATM, known as the Docuteller, started a chain reaction. Following Chemical’s lead, City National Bank and Trust Company introduced its own “Cash and Carry” machine in Ohio in 1970, and Chase Manhattan Bank installed its first ATM at its location in Grand Central Station in 1973.<br/><br/>Well, the rest is history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Photo by Kathrin Swaboda. Grand prize winner of the 2019 Audubon Photography Awards.” — ———————💭💭💭🦜 ———————Well uh. <br/>I don’t have anything to say. <br/>Except that I love this photo and I do love me some red wing bb’s. I’ve spent many a late afternoon or evening when all the other rustlers and chattelers and scurriers have become more still than the wind and still these red winged blackbirds are out there, powerfully perched and poised for war on a wayward cattail, or huddling together on some half wet, half dry cushion of moss inches above a marshy water line. <br/>A Gizmodo.com article about this photo says our feathered friend here was singing to “defend its territory”. I’m gonna call an audible on this one and say thats most likely incorrect.<br/><br/>For one, it’s mid-March. These guys are the die hards. The ones who stayed. A hardy bunch of stubborn blue blooded North Americans like the rest of us. They’ve been settled into their little claim of wetland for quite some time now. Probably since late August. There are no challengers. No threat. Just the cutting stillness of late Winter air.<br/><br/>Secondly, his body language. When male Red-winged Blackbirds display to defend and define their territory, they stretch their wings, sometimes tilt forward a bit, and cry out their signature multi-octave whoop. This guy is cool as a cucumber, just whistling a familiar tune and pumping out a vapor ring or two. Light work. Literally.—————————————————————Anyhow. Take a look at that map in the second image a little closer. If you’re in the purple, you’ve got red-winged blackbirds with you all year. Orange is just during the breeding months (i.e. spring/summer) and blue is a special area where they don’t breed at all. For some reason. Go figure.<br/><br/>Do me a favor and find a little nature spot by some pond or lake or wetland. Keep an eye out for these guys tucked into some vegetation that has good sight lines on the water’s edge. Cattails are usually a guarantee. If you find one or twelve, DM us about it. We read everything. 🌿🌿🌿<br/>( @sagegibbons )</p>]]></content:encoded>

At the Elbe, American troops were already too deep into the agreed-upon de jure Soviet jurisdiction, and Eisenhower did not want to risk an estimated 100,000 men to take control of land he would have to concede over to the Soviets once the war ended. <br/>Why is this important?<br/>Well, by the 25th, American and Soviet troops met at the Elbe and celebrated their monumental conquest of Germany. A few years later, this river became the marker of a new conflict: the Cold War. <br/>_____<br/>In 1965, Charles de Gaulle offered a vision which would thaw a globe frosted over by two decades of conflict between the U.S. and U.S.S.R. <br/>General de Gaulle announced the ”One Europe” vision. One Europe would extend from ”the Atlantic to the Urals,” embracing not merely the countries of the European Common Market, but those of the European Free Trade Association and the Communist lands of the Warsaw Pact.<br/>De Gaulle distanced himself from the American and Soviet conflict, a conflict he always considered ahistorical and unwise. <br/>De Gaulle pulled France out of NATO and began to negotiate with the Soviets on France’s terms. <br/>With no more cowboys in the White House barking orders at de Gaulle, he signaled a new global balance of power which extended Europe’s influence from Western Europe to the Ural Mountains in Russia. Here, the Urals symbolically replaced the Elbe. <br/>The Urals are considered the border between “European” Russia and ”Asian” Russia. With Macron sliding in the polls and the Gilet Jaunes still waging their protests, he is taking France an unusual step backward to move Europe forward. <br/>Macron the Gaullist?

Khaled’s murder is painful to revisit. I remember the headlines coming out in 2014-2015 of ISIL’s horrendous crimes: Jame’s Foley’s beheading, the heads of Shiites lining the streets of Raqqa, the genocide of the Yazidis. It was all becoming unbearable to keep up with from my lofty distance here in America. Then came Khaled&apos;s murder. <br/>Khaled was 83 when ISIL entered Palmyra. He was the director of the ancient city’s Antiques archive whose historical depth and meticulous safekeeping codified Palmyra as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In anticipation of the Islamic State’s looting, he hid the most precious artifacts in a spot whose whereabouts were known only to him. When ISIL entered the city, they ordered Khaled to reveal the archive to them, and for his compliance, they would spare him a gruesome death. <br/>Khaled read the news just like I did. He knew ISIL rarely kept prisoners, especially the elderly whose ages hindered them from accepting the legitimacy of an infantile government. Khaled refused, despite the advice from family and colleagues to comply. <br/>Around noon on Sunday, four year ago, Khaled was beheaded publically in the ancient city’s square. The NYT reported the following day: ”After detaining him for weeks, the jihadists dragged him on Tuesday to a public square where a masked swordsman cut off his head in front of a crowd, Mr. Asaad&apos;s relatives said. His blood-soaked body was then suspended with red twine by its wrists from a traffic light, his head resting on the ground between his feet, his glasses still on, [...].” ISIL, in the fashion of the Mongols, made an example of Palmyra by reducing the city to rubble. <br/>This year, the artifacts hidden by Khaled have begun to be showcased in museums in Syria for the first time since 2015. <br/>Thanks to Khaled’s heroism, we can still marvel the treasures of history and the power of the human will. <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

The air at subsonic speed (slower than sound) is influenced by the incoming pressure front created by the truck to get out of the way. At supersonic speeds, there isn’t enough time for the air in front to be ‘warned’ of the changing pressure.

Often, they start with the ‘fact’ that humans experience free will first hand, and continue by doing their best to make this experience compatible with a consistent view of the world. The standard argument is to point out that there is just matter and motion, and that this state of the universe, including your brain, mind and soul if there is such a thing, is the product of an ocean of prior causes, none of which were ultimately caused or controlled by you.  Your brain, environment, genetics, thoughts and actions are all caused by phenomena completely outside of your control so where’s the free will?  @SamHarrisOrg, who has spent long periods studying meditation with renowned masters around the world, argues and in fact demonstrates in his meditation app ‘Waking Up’, that the first person experience of free will isn’t even there when you look for it. That is, the problem that philosophers have been grappling with for centuries is in fact an illusory one.<br/><br/>To follow up on this week’s #PhilosophyMonday check out #SamHarris ‘s work on free will and tell us what you think! Do we have free will? Do we experience it? Does free will change how we view ethics? [ @matthewzehnbauer ]</p>]]></content:encoded>

In Kingdom of Speech, Tom Wolfe demonstrates painfully and gleefully how much time can be wasted falling in line with the crowd piously fighting for their leader. How much of our great intellectual pursuits can amount to pettiness!<br/><br/>I agree entirely. Path dependency of thought is an ever-tempting mistress. What originality is left in a graduate student’s brain after indoctrinating themself with the greats of their field? I would say none, but I have a source of optimism: Theory. Theory is the wellspring of discovery. It is only through theory that we can ever hope to anchor our explorations to reality.<br/><br/>Wolfe concludes that language put a halt to evolution, and that speech is the source of the spade, the dance, the iPhone, the religion, the social class. All these created by our emergent wit. Perhaps. But I am quite positive that he is misguided. These things are all evolutionary, just not strictly biological. They are cultural. <br/>Cultural evolution is the term- still widely unknown to most, including the late Tom Wolfe.<br/><br/>When we learn from the most successful or the most self-similar, we are mechanizing an adaptive process. The same for when we correct and update our inherited cultural information by interaction with the people around us. These automatic inheritance behaviors are responsible for the cultural innovations of our species, language included. Wolfe is right to say that if you remove language, you lose everything that makes us, us. But he is wrong in concluding that language is somehow removed from the same chain of causation that created our hominid line. Rather, it just accelerated our distinction.<br/><br/>Wolfe never got there, but you can. Look up Joe Henrich. Oh no, I’m doing it too! Charisma triumphs! Or is it Theory? You decide.<br/>@sagegibbons</p>]]></content:encoded>

Many mistake it for the Rod of Asclepius, the traditional symbol of healing. This rod is, in fact, the Caduceus, the symbol of commerce and Hermes, the Greek god of merchants, thieves, trickery, travelers, and sports. <br/>________<br/><br/>Now knowing what the Caduceus represents, do you see any issues with this symbol’s use in the medical field?<br/><br/>Quoting Stuart Tyson in the Scientific Monthly: ”As god of the high-road and the market-place Hermes was perhaps above all else the patron of commerce and the fat purse: as a corollary, he was the special protector of the traveling salesman. As spokesman for the gods, he not only brought peace on earth (occasionally even the peace of death), but his silver-tongued eloquence could always make the worse appear the better cause. From this latter point of view, would not his symbol be suitable for certain Congressmen, all medical quacks, book agents and purveyors of vacuum cleaners, rather than for the straight-thinking, straight-speaking therapeutist?” _______<br/><br/>What do you think? Is Tyson melodramatic, or does he have a point?<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Place, style, and purpose guide the graffiti artist’s strokes and sprays. <br/>Does graffiti inherently indicate the demise of a society?  Do names, statements, and images painted illegally on the sides of buildings, train cars, street signs, etc., merely reflect a crumbling, problematic community, or does it inspire a need for social reform and movements that will empower oppressed and alienated populations?  Should we be so quick to cover up the “tags” and “throw-ups” we see, or should we take a moment to look past the “ugliness” of the vandalism and study the ugliness of oppression, corruption, political misconduct, and violation of human rights?<br/><br/>For more on this, you can follow the link in our bio to read the longer version of this post. <br/>_____<br/>@dkaovlibd</p>]]></content:encoded>

He was an intellectual who spent his writing life knocking the arrogance of intellectuals. <br/>Montaigne’s contemporaries explained that our powers of reason allow us to  experience happiness and greatness that is denied to other creatures. Michel was skeptical of this, and believed that humans tend to be far too arrogant about their brains. “Our lives consist partly in madness, partly in wisdom,” he wrote “Whoever writes about it merely respectfully and by rule leaves more than half of it behind.” Being an eccentric guy, Montaigne took farts, penises, and shitting as serious topics for contemplation. He told his readers that he liked complete silence when using the bathroom: “Of all the natural operations, [shitting] is one during which I least willingly tolerate being disrupted.” If only Aristotle or Plato or Epicurus spent as much time writing on these topics.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Edison is often credited with inventing the first motion picture camera.<br/><br/>This is far from reality.<br/><br/>The first functioning motion picture camera was a result of the arduous work of two men that lived on opposite sides of the planet. By the 1870s, the American photographer Eadweard Muybridge and the French scientist Etienne-Jules Marey both had the same, somewhat strange, goal. They wanted to measure the precise movements of horses in motion. Because of the limitations of the human eye, a horse’s gait was a serious intellectual debate of the time. While Marey wanted to use this knowledge to perfect a scientific method to prove Charles Darwin’s theory of evolution, Muybridge was commissioned by a railroad tycoon to find out if a horse lifted all four legs off the ground while trotting. <br/>_________<br/><br/>In 1877 Muybridge built a special track with 12 electrically operated cameras that were triggered by a running horse tripping over a series of wires. This led to 12 pictures of a horse running taken in succession. For the first time, the human eye was able to see the exact movements of a horse in stride. Muybridge also succeeded at his task of proving that a horse does lift all four legs off the ground while trotting. <br/>_________<br/><br/>By 1879, Muybridge repeated his experiment, this time with 24 cameras. He also developed a machine used for projecting the images from a motion wheel on a large screen. He traveled across America and Europe showcasing his invention. In France, Muybridge met with the extremely curious Etienne-Jules Marey, who was greatly inspired by the successful experiment. <br/>_________<br/><br/>Marey, however, argued that the 24 separate cameras did not provide the level of consistency needed for proper scientific experiments. Therefore, he decided on creating a single, gun-like, device able to record at least 12 frames per second. In 1882, Marey succeeded. His rifle shaped camera was capable of taking 12 photographs on one plate in one second. <br/>This was the first-ever motion picture camera. <br/>@growncudi</p>]]></content:encoded>

I see it too, but it’s not unique, not truly real until I stare at it in the mirror for an uncomfortable period of time. I stare, looking into my eyes, letting minutes pass, moving forward and backward, retreating and advancing, feeling as if I am being watched by someone I don’t know. <br/>It was frightening seeing myself in the mirror with a blank, emotionless look the other night. That face rarely meets the public’s eye. It’s just for me, my little secret. It makes me happy knowing my face has secrets. <br/>Here’s what I want from you. <br/>Stare at yourself in the mirror. Look at yourself just like you look at this painting. <br/>Observe, create deeper meaning, find the mistakes that prove imperfection is a feature of beauty, take a step away to see the bigger picture, move closer to determine what you want to see in yourself, and decide on your favorite colors. <br/>It’s late here in Lake Como. I should sleep. Until next time!<br/><br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

On this week’s #PhilosophyMonday we’re going to give you this man’s answer.<br/><br/>Albert Camus was French-Algerian writer and philosopher. He died at the age of 47, when his publisher crashed his Facel Vega sports car into a tree with both of them in it. In his pocket was a train ticket he decided not to use at the last moment.<br/><br/>Camus is famous for a handful of works. ‘The Outsider’ and his essay ‘The Myth of Sisyphus’ are his most popular. The essay begins boldly: “There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide. Judging whether life is or is not worth living, that is the fundamental question of philosophy.” Do you agree? ( @matthewzehnbauer )</p>]]></content:encoded>

His extraordinary achievements are often overshadowed by those of his colleagues, Neil and Buzz, the first men to ever step on the moon 50 years ago. While these men were cementing the United States’ victory in the worldwide space race, Collins was ensuring that their lunar lander (Eagle) could safely rendezvous with the command module (Columbia) miles above the moon’s surface. <br/>He spent 21.5 hours orbiting the moon alone in the Columbia.  Each orbit, the Columbia would dip around to the far side of the moon, and Collins would be without radio contact for a full 48 minutes.  It’s the loneliest a person could possibly be, one would think. However, Collins repeatedly mandates that loneliness wasn’t on his mind; he was more concerned for the welfare of his crewmates on the lunar surface below.<br/><br/>Collins passed the time by recording short notes on his tape recorder, rehearsing the 18 different docking maneuvers that he had personally designed.  He also preformed maintenance checks and housekeeping chores, all while preparing for rendezvous.<br/><br/>Once the lander had finished its mission and had taken off from the lunar surface, it was Michael Collins’ job to assure that the Columbia and Eager were aligned to the centimeter.  Even the smallest mistake would be catastrophic, leaving the astronauts stranded in the Eagle 385,000 kilometers from Earth.<br/><br/>The successful mission would have been a brutal failure without Michael Collins’ bravery, focus, and determination. A true American hero, Collins was instrumental in the most pivotal adventure of the 20th century. <br/>@ryan.scarpa</p>]]></content:encoded>

Infinitely many?<br/><br/>Nope, 3. Only triangles, squares and hexagons. This is a property of the geometry you learn in school, which is constructed from straight lines. But are there other kinds of geometry?<br/><br/>Yes!! And they can be beautiful. One version, known as hyperbolic geometry is my personal favorite. <br/>In the second image you can see the basis for the French mathematician Herni Poincaré’s model of hyperbolic geometry, it’s based on inscribed circles that intersect perpendicular to the outer circle. <br/>In the third image you can see one of these Poincaré disks colored all pretty.<br/><br/>In the fourth image, you can see a hyperbolic tessellation. As it turns out, there are infinitely many regular tessellations in this geometry vs. the 3 in the first one.<br/><br/>This beauty caught the eye of the visionary artist M.C. Escher. He created images based on advances in mathematics. [the last 5 images are Escher’s work]<br/><br/>But does this new math have any real use?<br/><br/>Yes, yes it does. While Escher was creating masterpieces, so was Stephen Hawking. Using a hyperbolic geometry, he created a mathematical way of extending the laws of physics beyond the observable universe. This breakthrough also implied an edge to the infinite universe (yes, you read that right) and also laid the groundwork for the Holographic Principle which predicts that our universe is a hologram (holy shit).

It doesn’t talk back to me, always makes me my food, and will protect me if anyone gets smart with me!” 76 years old and still a boy. <br/>I must say he’s a well financed and engineered 76. <br/>No wrinkles, the well toned muscles that his deliberate choice of slim cut clothing accentuates them well and <br/>of course<br/>the smug smile of a man that continues to evade Death’s calling. <br/>I laugh at his response, but only because I felt sorry for him. <br/>older men need the satisfaction of knowing they can still make young men laugh. <br/>this meeting was too critical, to career catapulting for me to take the moral high ground for a single moment.<br/>despite my credentials which usually raise a brow or two among my peers,<br/>he only accepted the one credential I earned without effort:<br/>youth. <br/>credentials only go so far with a man who recalls a different youth, <br/>whose fight for justice is muted by today’s injustice, <br/>whose parents are both dead, <br/>an orphan,<br/>he will not bother to make sense of my view of the world he helped create.<br/>i don’t blame him.<br/>overall, the interview was a failure.<br/>we were at our final bland, watered down sip of cointreau on the rocks. <br/>with it came a moment of rueful introspection, somewhere<br/>between self-pity <br/>and self-exoneration.<br/>we went outside.<br/>inside<br/>we confessed nothing,<br/>we learned nothing.<br/>but outside,<br/>we lit our cigarettes and exhaled,<br/>or more accurately,<br/>we sighed. <br/>the low lying, dark clouds above us trapped the crimson sun,<br/>like a fiery orange hell. <br/>we looked at each other and smiled.<br/>A common connection,<br/>finally. <br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>

Yesterday, eight properties were inaugurated into UNESCO. All eight came from one man, one American, Frank Llyod Wright.<br/><br/>The properties include Fallingwater in Pennsylvania, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Hollyhock House in Los Angeles, the Jacobs House in Wisconsin, the Robie House in Chicago, Taliesin in Wisconsin, Taliesin West in Arizona and the Unity Temple in Illinois.<br/><br/>These buildings now share the same status as Machu Picchu, the Pyramids of Giza, and the Statue of Liberty. So what makes his buildings worthy of such company?<br/><br/>Two words: organic architecture.<br/><br/>He made buildings in the image of his materials and surroundings, whereas most modern architects use materials in the image of buildings. He believed his materials had themes and central ideas that were all based on what they were made of, and he made them literally a part of their surroundings as naturally as possible. He was the first architect to use concrete the way he did, making whole buildings out of it because of how it can be molded to any shape you want and it will always hold.<br/>(@joe_delvicario)</p>]]></content:encoded>

He killed 15 people and wounded 33 others.<br/><br/>In what was essentially his suicide note, Whitman described a change in his emotions. He outlined his newfound rage and desire to cause harm, before instructing doctors to perform an autopsy in order to figure out what the hell was going on.<br/><br/>The photo above is a scan of Charles Whitman’s brain. Shown on that scan is a tumor pressing on his amygdala- a roughly almond-shaped mass <br/>of gray matter found inside each cerebral hemisphere, and involved with the feeling of emotions. This is exactly the place where a tumor would have the effects experienced by Whitman. Assuming the tumor played a role is his actions, was Charles Whitman an evil man? Was he morally responsible for his actions? [ @matthewzehnbauer ]</p>]]></content:encoded>

She sports a beard even longer and more luxurious than that of her husband, who gazes forlornly at the viewer from the murky, shadowy background.<br/><br/>One of the underlying themes of The Bearded Woman is Ribera&apos;s attempt to subtly reinforce Magdalena&apos;s femininity. This is most strongly suggested by the exposure of her strange, Cyclops-like breast as she nurses a newborn infant. Magdalena was fifty-two years old and her three sons were assuredly no longer breastfeeding. Therefore, this baby is symbolic, serving to emphasize the fact that, despite her luxurious beard, the subject of this portrait is emphatically a woman. (@joe_delvicario)</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Pope watched and admired their noble parts”. “Members of the clergy and other party guests had sex with the prostitutes for prizes. Servants kept score of each man’s orgasms, for the pope greatly admired virility; and measured a man’s machismo by his ejaculative capacity.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Before Sue’s work, microaggression was not yet in our lexicon. <br/>________<br/><br/>In image three, Sue defines what a microaggression is and offers yet another racial example but this time coming from the late Senator John McCain. <br/>________<br/><br/>I am pointing this out to add contextual legitimacy in the current debate between Joe Biden and the media at large over his shaky history of racial insensitivity. I don’t find Joe Biden to be a racist based on this example and the comments that sparked this debate which were about his fond memories of working alongside Senators who were segregationists despite their differences in views on race. I do, however, agree that his behavior exhibits case in point microaggressions, but to say he is a racist is a stretch. <br/>________<br/><br/>What are your thoughts on this term? Is it useful? Has it become dogma? Have you ever experienced a microaggression? (@joe_delvicario)</p>]]></content:encoded>

They had heard that dog meat was delicious, so they cut up the dog’s body, cooked it and ate it. Nobody saw them do this.<br/><br/>This thought experiment comes from Jonathan Haidt’s book The Righteous Mind. Haidt goes on to give a slightly more challenging story. Again, read this then pause and decide whether the people involved did anything morally wrong.<br/><br/>A man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a dead chicken. But before cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks it and eats it. No one knows he does this.<br/><br/>These questions and their answers help build a foundation for understating morality, the role of disgust, and the power of intuitions.<br/><br/>Comment or message us your thoughts about these stories.

This is no ordinary pistol from a by-gone era. No, this is the weapon that painter Vincent van Gogh allegedly used to commit suicide in July of 1890. ”Allegedly” is the key word here.<br/>______<br/><br/>According to biographers Gregory Smith and Steven Naifeh in their 2011 work, Van Gogh: The Life, van Gogh did not self-inflict the gunshot wound to the chest he later succumbed to after a thirty-hour battle. The biographers instead point to René Secréton, a 16-year-old who was spending the summer in Auvers-sur-Oise, the farming village where van Gogh lived and worked for the final years of his life. Secréton and his brother were known by people familiar with the boys to be hooligans who exploited van Gogh’s weakened mental state for their schadenfreude entertainment. <br/>______<br/><br/>The mystery of van Gogh’s death ultimately rests in this pistol, whose handle only knows the truth of who gripped it and pulled the trigger.

National Cookie Day. National Ugly Sweater Day. National Pie Day. You get the point.<br/><br/>However, the origins of Father’s Day are very genuine, tinged with sadness and can be specifically traced back to a little town in West Virginia called Monongah.<br/><br/>On December 6, 1907, 367 men were working in Fairmont Coal Company mines when, unexpectedly, an explosion occurred which killed an estimated 362 of the miners, with only four escaping and one being rescued by those who came to help. Sadly, the four who escaped later died due to injuries related to the incident. The Monongah Mining Disaster is widely considered “the worst mining disaster in American History” and devastated the surrounding community, as it estimated that over 1,000 children lost their fathers.<br/><br/>The idea of the town having a day to honor fathers began with Mrs. Grace Golden Clayton, who approached her minister at William’s Memorial Methodist Episcopal Chruch South with her plan. Although Clayton had not lost her father during the mining explosion, she was deeply affected by his death in 1896, which caused her to feel great sympathy for those who had lost their fathers.<br/><br/>So despite the fact that Father’s Day would not become an official holiday until 1972 by President Nixon, Monongah is the place where Father’s Day is most historically associated.

Here’s a map of “sentiment” for Manhattan and the surrounding area from analysis of keywords, phrases, and emojis in 600,000 tweets. Cyan is most positive; magenta, the most negative.<br/><br/>Here’s the bit I like:<br/>“We find that public mood is generally highest in public parks and lowest at transportation hubs, and locate other areas of extreme sentiment such as cemeteries, medical centers, a jail, and a sewage facility. Sentiment progressively improves with proximity to Times Square. Periodic patterns of sentiment fluctuate on both a daily and a weekly scale: more positive tweets are posted on weekends than on weekdays, with a daily peak in sentiment around midnight and a nadir between 9:00 a.m. and noon.” What a cool time to be in.

It is just like roads across the earth. For actually the earth had no roads to begin with, but when many men pass one way, a road is made.” __________<br/><br/>These words come from Lu Xun’s short story, “My Old Home.” Xun’s influence on the Chinese people has remained remarkably resilient since his writings reached the public in the early twentieth century. <br/>Xun depicted a laggard China at the turn of the twentieth century. Poverty, medicinal and technological backwardness, and the panopticon of oppression were  present in this China. With democracy and pluralism muted for millions of Chinese citizens, Western nations amassed conspicuous amounts of wealth with the nod from the Qing Dynasty who were financially indebted to European powers. <br/>_________<br/><br/>Today, the people of Hong Kong march with Xun by their sides in their fight to protect democracy and pluralism. Since 1997, the year Hong Kong shed its British skin and became an independent territory, the CCP has made multiple attempts to incorporate Hong Kong under their jurisdiction. <br/>_________<br/><br/>Please keep an eye on the protests currently being held in Hong Kong. The CCP has been relentless in their quest for Hong Kong. We may witness a final vestige of democracy collapse in China if Hong Kong fails to remain politically independent.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Was Picasso referring to the profiled Germaine Pichot seated beside him as the agile rabbit? Picasso, like a hunter of wild game, searched for the female spoor with pen and brush as his weapons of choice. He has found her, but Germaine could not look any more disinterested. Her mind is adrift in a far-flung, cavernous space while her body remains trapped in the poky cabaret with misfits and wannabes. Picasso is dressed as a harlequin, a colloquial term for a theater jester who wore diamond-patterned costumes. However, a harlequin is also a small duck known for its ability to navigate fast-moving streams. Stay here with me. <br/>_____<br/><br/>Picasso, the harlequin, navigates the fast-moving streets of Paris at the turn of the twentieth century. The twentieth century... where no political movement would be as glorious as the movement of the line across paper. The twentieth century began in the cafés and bars, where misfits and wannabes like Picasso, Chagall, Hemingway and Einstein determined they would dedicate their lives to the pursuit of a new Star of Bethlehem for the modern world. <br/>_____<br/><br/>We are still searching for that star.<br/>j.d.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In 2010, his book about the contemporary art world, La carte et le territoire (The Map and the Territory), was awarded the Prix Goncourt, France’s highest literary honor. In 2015, Houellebecq published Soumission (Submission), a novel about the democratic election of a Muslim president who unexpectedly decides to govern the French state according to strict Islamic law. In a macabre turn of events, Houellebecq’s novel was published on the same day as the tragic Charlie Hebdo shooting in Paris; in a dark coincidence, that week’s issue of the magazine featured a cartoon of Houellebecq on the cover, alongside the caption “The Predictions of Wizard Houellebecq.” Houellebecq’s production, however, has never been limited to writing, and in 2016, he mounted a widely discussed and extremely well attended exhibition at the Palais de Tokyo called “Rester Vivant” (To Stay Alive), which featured a sweeping multimedia installation of Houellebecq’s photography, filmmaking, and writing.

If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you’ve been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.

The result is a spectacular eruption of loud little insects.<br/><br/>A remarkable fact, which comes from Richard Dawkins’ ‘The Blind Watchmaker’, is that there isn’t just one 13-year species and one 17-year species, rather there are THREE species, and each one of those three has both a 17-year and a 13-year variety, or race. <br/>This division into two races of 13 and 17-year cycles has been arrived at independently at least THREE times.<br/><br/>The plot thickens once you discover that there are no varieties with 14, 15 and 16-year cycles. Why? Well, no one knows for sure, but a hypothesis that I find beautiful, suggests that prime numbers are playing a role here.<br/><br/>A prime number, depending which mathematician you ask, is a number which is only divisible by itself and 1. The idea here is that any species that regularly erupts in plagues gains the benefit of going back and forth between ‘swamping’ and starving it’s predators.<br/><br/>If these plagues are timed carefully to occur a prime number of years apart, it makes it much more difficult for the predators to synchronize their own life cycles. If the cicadas erupted every 14 years, for example, they could be exploited by a species with a 7-year life cycle.<br/><br/>We don’t know what’s special about 13 and 17 years, but evolutionarily speaking, something is important, since three separate species have converged on them independently.

There are a variety of things that are extraordinary about this anniversary. <br/>__________<br/><br/>First of all, as we are talking about it 30 years on, the government is still trying to repress discussion of it. Even though the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is, in many ways, in a position of strength akin to the Mao years, at this moment you can’t help but see a deep insecurity by the CCP in its lack of confidence in making its own story stick. It has a story that it sometimes tells, about it being necessary to use force to create the stability that China needed to develop. But it obviously isn’t confident enough of that story to allow broad discussion of what took place many Junes ago. The more I think about it, the reason why I think it has so much trouble dealing with it is that a core part of the story that the CCP tells its people about why it deserves to rule has to do with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). The PLA was the force that helped liberate the Chinese people from mistreatment by disloyal rulers who sold China to foreign partners. But what we saw 30 years ago was the People’s Liberation Army behaving very much like an army of occupation. This is an obstacle that the West should highlight more. <br/>_________<br/><br/>Another interesting point to be made is Tiananmen’s aura of Stalinism. A trademark of Stalin’s version of communism was the state’s monopoly on violence against its own people. In 1989, Eastern Europe’s Iron Curtain fell and was shed to pieces by the millions who lived in the shadows of the burgeoning democratic world for far too long. In contrast to Eastern Europe, the 1989 protests in China did not lead to the overthrow of the Communist Party. Therefore, China is the final vestige of one of history’s most dramatic civilizational projects: Stalinist communism. (j.d.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

They follow the explosive “leaf out” of the deciduous forests and the insect protein it brings, as well as the opportunity to stake out a territory, find a mate, and make a name for themselves. If you’re lucky, an opposing wind might force a momentary pause, affording a few days to discover exotic travelers who hail from deep within a balmy rainforest or iridescent South American grassland, now resting in your backyard.<br/><br/>It used to be the best way to track these migrants would be to turn a pair of binoculars towards the moon in hopes of identifying a silhouette. We’ve come a long way since then. The above animated map comes from eBird- a citizen science platform that allows naturalists world-wide to contribute their observations to conservation and research. I highly encourage you to check it out.<br/><br/>During a transformative trip through Costa Rica with a biology class, I remember tracing a Barn Swallow carve the air acrobatically to catch invisible insects over an expansive wetland. My professor informed me that they are North American migrants and can be seen back in New York too. A wave of admiration and closeness fell over me as I realized the tiny Swallow would journey with me all the way back home. <br/>Since that trip, recognizing the vibrant plumage of a Neptropical migrant arises within me a profound sense of connection and deeper identity. To have experiences with nature is to be a part of it. I hope this post inspires you to look closer, stay longer, and discover your own secret community.

You can even see the easing of the awkward, scripted tension after their hands meet firmly on her hip. It was time to get real. She loses the melodramatic lines and begins to enchant this California raisin of a man with her waltzing eyes and her soft words. Now they have a sexual tension that weaves desire, lust, and vulnerability between them.<br/><br/>This is one of Lynch’s finest scenes, thanks to Naomi’s acceptance of Lynch’s vision which aims to deliver genuine performances in a dream-like world.<br/>(j.d.)</p>]]></content:encoded>

Blue and yellow dominate this scene, with touches of red seen on the mother and daughter. Now, you see the green as well, right? Cassatt used green to balance blue and yellow, just as it does on the color wheel where it rests between the two (third image). Try and break down the color triad of the next beautiful sunset you catch yourself marveling at. <br/>I hope we can begin to look at the world just as we look at these paintings.

Similarly, the dashboard of the car appears stationary from the perspective of the passengers, but appears to be moving from the point of view of the hitch-hiker. This claim is so basic and intuitive that we hardly take note of it.<br/><br/>#AlbertEinstein ‘s Theory of Special Relativity proclaims that the differences between two observers are more subtle than one might expect.<br/><br/>#SpecialRelativity states that observers in relative motion will have different perceptions of distance and time. <br/>This means that identical wristwatches worn by two individuals in relative motion will tick at different rates and hence will not agree on the amount of time that elapses between chosen events. Special Relativity demonstrates that this statement does not slander the accuracy of the wristwatches involved; rather it is a true statement about time itself.<br/><br/>Similarly, observers in relative motion carrying identical tape measures will not agree on the lengths of distances measured. Again, this is not due to inaccuracies in the measuring devices or to errors in how they used, but is a property about distance itself.<br/><br/>For more on this topic, check out ‘The Elegant Universe’ by theoretical physicist, Brian Greene.<br/>[m.z.]</p>]]></content:encoded>

It hasn&apos;t happened – and there are no signs that it will. The brittle plastic of an e-reader, however colorful the cove, doesn&apos;t have the physical presence of a printed volume. Nor can a click on the ‘buy now’ button on the Kindle Store replicate a lunch hour spent sauntering a bookshop and rummaging through the contents of an aisle piled high with out-of-print treasures.<br/>_____<br/><br/>But did you know printed books were declared ”dead” much earlier than the appearance of the e-reader?<br/>_____<br/>In 1894, in an essay entitled ”The End of Books,” French writer Octave Uzanne wrote: ”Reading, as we practice it today, soon brings on great weariness; for not only does it require of the brain a sustained attention which consumes a large proportion of the cerebral phosphates, but it also forces our bodies into various fatiguing attitudes.” Books are desirable objects. They are made to be read and to be displayed. They ask to be touched and turned, with each volume exuding a distinct odor that sends us back to the time the pages were last opened. <br/>I’m sure Uzanne would agree with me, considering he authored multiple books over his illustrious career. But books were not the focus of his 1894 essay evidently. It was the act of reading. Uzanne was a marvelous observer of his own time. He figured that with the advancements in visual and phonographic technology, reading could transform into a leisure activity which required no use of the physical book in hand. With the competitiveness of innovation and changing urban landscapes, Uzanne made the prescient prediction that modern society will not have the time, not the will power, to sit still and focus their mind on ink amidst new technologies. <br/>_____<br/>“Either the books must go, or they must swallow us up. [...] Our social condition forces us to hear many stupid things every day. A few more or less do not amount to very great suffering in the end; but what happiness not to be obliged to read them, and to be able at last to close our eyes upon the annihilation of printed things!”</p>]]></content:encoded>

As I read this page this morning, I found this highlighted paragraph to be one of the most important excerpts I have found in quite some time. <br/>_____<br/>If you remove the United States and place China here, what do we see? We the Belt and Road Initiative. The impact of the Panama Canal then is analogous to the effects of the 2008 Financial Crisis. The Crisis stymied the American development model in Asia and placed China at the center of Asia’s development ever since. In a very real sense, what we saw in 2008 was the shifting allegiance of billions of people from Washington to Beijing in a matter of weeks. When Adams stated the United States was an “imperial economy,” he would have found it unfathomable to picture a future where the U.S. competed with China for global power. Remember, in 1903, China had yet to abolish the civil service test, concubinage, and was still ruled by the Qing Dynasty. Furthermore, European and American delegations carved up much of China’s fertile eastern coast and its cities after the Boxer Rebellion of 1900. <br/>______<br/>“The West Indies drift towards us, the Republic of Mexico hardly longer has an independent life, and the city of Mexico is an American town.” Could we not revise this to fit our contemporary mold? “Europe drifts towards us, Central Asia hardly longer has an independent life, and the city of Urumqi is a Chinese town.”<br/>[j.d.]</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://auzaren.github.io/malleable-brains-ig-claude/media/posts/201905/18068555512009726.jpg" alt="Post image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/></p><p>Norman Rockwell was criticized by those in the art world as being not an artist but an illustrator. His optimistic and appealing style was exoteric and therefore at odds with the demands of esoteric academic evaluations. I recently discovered the word exoteric: &quot;intended for or likely to be understood by the general public” in contrast to esoteric: “intended for or likely to be understood by only a small number of people with a specialized knowledge or interest.” Rockwell illustrated covers for the US’s most popular magazine, the Saturday Evening Post, from 1916 to 1963, boosting sales every time. Magazine covers require intuitive content, which is likely the reason for the art world’s dismissal of him. Art can be intuitive, but it should also allow the viewer to look further and deeper, to reflect on one’s own connotation within the denotation.<br/><br/>Although oriented for the masses as he was, does Rockwell truly provide nothing further for the viewer to consider? I reject this for one simple reason: Rockwell is funny! <br/>His Triple Self-Portrait is all tongue in cheek. Tasked with painting himself, he decides to paint himself painting himself. His tilted body language, the precarious glass of Coca Cola, and the metal pail smoking with pipe ash all draw a smile. Rockwell’s use of humor and character to tell a story allows the masses to participate in introspective consideration just as more conceptually layered art does. <br/>Cast in this light, it seems the art world’s dismissal of Rockwell comes from a sense of superiority. With all of their specialized (read: esoteric) knowledge, he provides nothing for them to do. Yes, Rockwell is likely to be seen in a nursing home or dentist’s office more than in a museum, but maybe that’s the point.<br/><br/>Ironically, Andy Warhol’s pop art (or modern art) revolution would begin a decade or so later, taking consumer icons and repurposing them into works which were esoteric and exoteric at the same time. Rockwell may predate Warhol’s partnering art for the masses with intellectualized art, but by adding the human universal of story to his vignettes, he found a new partnership: art for the masses and art for the soul. @sagegibbons</p>]]></content:encoded>

Advanced music, to the extent that it reflects the knowledge and originality of the composer, scarcely can be expected to appear more intelligible than these arts and sciences to the person whose musical education usually has been even less extensive than his background in other fields. But to this, a double standard is invoked, with the words ’music is music,’ implying also that ’music is just music.’ Why not, then, equate the activities of the radio repairman with those of the theoretical physicist, on the basis of the dictum that ’physics is physics?’...” ______ [m.z.]</p>]]></content:encoded>

While this headline is commonplace in many parts of the world, it is quite saddening to learn that its source comes from Northern Ireland. <br/>Today, the Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed responsibility for the murdering of Lyra McKee. The IRA is back, but only in the pages of the international press. If you are a resident in Belfast, the news of the McKee’s death won&apos;t come as a surprise. <br/>According to the Belfast-based organization Detail Data, the IRA was responsible for 22 killings, more than 1,000 shootings and bombings, 787 paramilitary-style attacks and nearly 4,000 reports of people forced to flee their homes between 2006 and 2015. <br/>The Troubles is back.

Thompson from his 1994 eulogy to the late president: ”He was scum.<br/><br/>Let there be no mistake in the history books about that. Richard Nixon was an evil man -- evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it. He was utterly without ethics or morals or any bedrock sense of decency. Nobody trusted him -- except maybe the Stalinist Chinese, and honest historians will remember him mainly as a rat who kept scrambling to get back on the ship.<br/><br/>He was a cheap crook and a merciless war criminal who bombed more people to death in Laos and Cambodia than the U.S. Army lost in all of World War II, and he denied it to the day of his death. When students at Kent State University, in Ohio, protested the bombing, he connived to have them attacked and slain by troops from the National Guard.<br/><br/>Some people will say that words like scum and rotten are wrong for Objective Journalism -- which is true, but they miss the point. It was the built-in blind spots of the Objective rules and dogma that allowed Nixon to slither into the White House in the first place. He looked so good on paper that you could almost vote for him sight unseen. He seemed so all-American, so much like Horatio Alger, that he was able to slip through the cracks of Objective Journalism. You had to get Subjective to see Nixon clearly, and the shock of recognition was often painful.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

We sinners look to the earth, our priest, for penance. The absolution we wish will not come in the form of prayer or meditation. It will go only by action. <br/>There are plenty of ways to mitigate the damage humans inflict on nature. Some damage is reversible. Most is not. The one thing we can reverse is our relationship to nature. <br/>Here in Binghamton, nature is suppressed by human faculties. The carcass of the industrial era rots alongside budding flowers and chirping birds. Car exhaustion lingers longer than the sound of air shuffling the leaves. The mechanized sounds of the old factories survive in the streets. <br/>But remember that nature is not a sleeping giant. Just as the priest stands alone in dying churches amidst rising cities, nature is always with us to remind us we have an eternal home, Earth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Thoughts?<br/>____________<br/><br/>Norman Foster, British architect and head of the international design firm Foster + Partners, is quoted in the London Times: &quot;submissions should embrace the boldness of the original builders, who pushed the limits of the technology of the day with their flying buttresses.&quot; Lord Foster was responsible for the 1999 reconstruction of the Reichstag in Berlin. The glass dome that now rests atop the Reichstag replaced the original stone dome which was destroyed during the Second World War. Lord Foster&apos;s proposed glass spire aspires to become a work of art that can wed our contemporary zeitgeist to the eternity of spirituality.<br/><br/>Foster&apos;s plan has the approval of other notable architects such as Ian Ritchie, creator of the Spire of Dublin, and Ptolemy Dean, the incumbent Surveyor of the Fabric of Westminster Abbey.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize an important distinction here. What we are witnessing is the difference between restoration and recreation. All art is essentially the result of reflecting on something and then representing it. Lord Foster and his ilk have reflected on the fire and concluded that the roof of Notre Dame could be &quot;reconstructed&quot; to represent modern times architecturally and, more important, symbolically. The reconstruction process also aims to recreate. The contrarians who oppose the glass spire and roof wish to ”restore” them to their original states, but with safer features included to ensure a fire of similar magnitude doesn’t occur again. By restoring the roof and spire to its original states, the contrarians believe the Notre Dame’s original corporeal features will continue to illuminate the cathedral without the need of sunlight.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This seems like a silly question to ask you, my unknown audience. But as I reflect on today’s events in Paris and the state of the world, I see much continuity with our past. <br/>A few weeks ago, China secured a multi-billion dollar deal with the Italian government as part of China’s Belt &amp; Road Initiative. Where did this deal take place? Venice, the city Marco Polo departed from and returned to after his travels along the ancient Silk Road that led to Beijing. China’s Belt &amp; Road has united Asia with parts of Europe and Africa, recreating the ancient Silk Road and fulfilling the expeditionary vision of Zhang He’s voyages during the 15th century. Is the Belt &amp; Road Initiative not the new Dutch East India Company in reverse? China has broken history, flattening time as if we were living in Zurvan’s universe. <br/>The populism in Europe reminds me of the religious zealotry of the Europeans against the Ottomans during the 15th century. It was not uncommon for disenfranchised Westerners to escape Europe and find refuge in Ottoman lands in Northern Africa and the Levant during the 15th century as well. Do we need see the same brain drains and diasporas from these lands to the West now?<br/><br/>The Catholic Church has always been the enemy of current fashions. The Church sets itself against the fashions of this world which will soon pass away. As the many fashions reign and eventually pass (e.g., governments, ideologies, etc.), the Church stands alone, fearless and poised to remind future generations of our story so that we are not forgotten in vain. The Catholic Church has changed in many ways since the 15th century. However, what will not change is the beauty of the monumental statues, the cavernous cathedrals and the timelessness of faith which all show us how much we have changed. <br/>And fallen.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The phone&apos;s digital compass was also supplemented by a call to prayer alarm which helped the user remember to adhere to the Salat, the five obligatory daily prayers in Islam. <br/>The former Executive Vice President of LG, Kenn Suh, stated: &quot;No matter where the faithful are at the call to prayer, they will be able to easily identify the direction of Mecca with this phone. The Qiblah phone is the product of our on-going effort to meet local and cultural demands. We had conducted market research on the culture and needs of the customers in the Middle East. LG Electronics plans to continually develop and unveil specialized products tailored to the needs of the local market.&quot; In 2005, the Netherlands became the first European country to sell a similar phone, the IIkone i800, in its domestic markets.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Ask why we fought or what we accomplished, and &quot;democracy&quot; and ”freedom” are the most likely (dare I say vague) responses. The circulation of confusing or lofty rationales for intervention began as soon as President Woodrow Wilson secured a war declaration from Congress in April 1917. <br/>__________<br/>America is alone in its quixotic imagination of the First World War. We see this exemplified in the contrast between American and European perceptions of world order and history. Ever since the First World War, Europe has felt an underlying pessimism, a sense of danger and disorder that the United States hasn’t shared. Americans have continued to believe that progress is built into history. Most Europeans, other than Marxists, dropped this notion once the Great War began.<br/>__________<br/>Europeans still call it the ”Great War”—not only because it was catastrophic and momentous, but also because it changed the nature of war itself. Civilian life became a new front line. Europe’s first genocide seen with the Armenians set the tone for the rest of the century. Empires collapsed and fragile nations remained. The epoch of chemical warfare began (some scholars have determined that in 1918, one out of four shells dropped on the Western Front was poisonous). There&apos;s still more to mention, but this space will never truly encapsulate what made the Great War a watershed moment in history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how it began: <br/>______<br/>&quot;We are discreetly removed from the madness of yesterday on the campuses,&quot; Buckley begins, &quot;though an apostolate survives and is perhaps regrouping to strike again. At what? &apos;At America&apos; is the easiest way to put it.&quot; Mr. Rader (left) is emphatically of that disposition, Mr. Beichman (right) emphatically is not. The conversation sometimes spins into outer space but never slows down. Beichman: &quot;&apos;All power to the people&apos; is your signature line. What people were you talking about?&quot; Rader: &quot;It&apos;s basically a populist position.&quot; Beichman: &quot;What people--not the hardhats, obviously. You wouldn&apos;t want them to have power.&quot; Rader: &quot;No, I think the basic thrust of the New Left... We always make a mistake because we assume the New Left is Marxist, which it&apos;s not.&quot; Beichman: &quot;Is it Leninist?&quot; Rader: &quot;... No, I think in spirit it is basically 18th century. That&apos;s how it began--18th-century constitutionalism.... This, coupled with disillusionment with American institutions, coming largely out of the response of those institutions to what were rather good-natured, traditional protests of grievances, the war--&quot; Beichman: &quot;Wait a minute. &apos;Good-natured&apos;--you lost me there.&quot; Rader: &quot;I think they were good-natured.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

Her films came to define the industry’s depiction of the ”new woman” on screen during the New Wave. The ”new woman” was misanthropic yet majestic. The intoxication that oozed off these women was rooted in their sharp wit, coquettish demeanor, and subtle intelligence. These women left men numb and defenseless, always two steps behind their elegant prey who could now outrun their captors. <br/>Thanks to her contributions, today’s neophytes may become tommorow’s icons. <br/>She will be truly missed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

André Malraux, as usual, comes to mind since he likened the writer to the artist, one who directs their life towards asking questions instead of searching for answers. However, I find Flannery O’Connor’s idea of the writer to be of equal merit. <br/>O’Connor advises the writer to be humble before the concrete world. She wrote that, “what the fiction writer will discover, if he discovers anything at all is that he himself cannot move or mold reality in the interests of abstract truth. The writer learns, perhaps more quickly than the reader, to be humble in the face of what-is. What-is is all he has to do with; the concrete is his medium; and he will realize eventually that fiction can transcend its limitations only by staying within them.” Like Malraux, O&apos;Connor defines a writer by his or her actions in the concrete world of what-is. The writer questions the world by acting on the page.<br/>______<br/>During a recent conversation with @sagegibbons, we discussed the effectiveness of Michel Houellebecq’s prose. We agreed that Michel blends fiction with reality unlike the herd of contemporary fictionists since he is not a world-builder like Tolkien or Rowling but instead is a world-deconstructionist. A reader of Submission will agree that Houellebecq does not allude to reality but throws it in your face with the wit of Twain and the precision of a sociologist. But by staying within the bounds of fiction, Houellebecq is allowed to have his ideas transcend the work without being ground to a priori experience. At once, his work is both a priori and a posteriori, a description and prescription of the world. <br/>The beauty of fiction’s boundaries is that once you enter them, your words can transcend the page and even death. <br/>My definition of the writer is still in the works, but I am grateful to those who have preceded me and whose eternal slumber bears no effect on their ability to remain by my side on my journey of questions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His brother moved to this remote anthracite abode to continue a Calvinist mission work his father began in the region years prior.<br/><br/>After almost a year in the dark and poverty-stricken landscape of the Borinage, he was losing any clarity he had about the direction his life was heading towards. Before Borinage, he was a teacher, an art dealer, and a bookseller.  He brought himself to the furthest limits of his Christian understanding of purpose at Borinage. As he tried to help the destitute community, giving them all of his money and clothes, moving out of the comfortable home he was living in and into a run-down abandoned miner’s hut, trying to live like them and care for them as Jesus would have, he had come to nothing. No one was saved.<br/><br/>Dismayed by Theo&apos;s vindictiveness towards his mission and his own inability to experience anything beyond corporeal existence, he embarked on an artistic pilgrimage to Courrieres to visit the French painter, Jules Breton.<br/><br/>His journey was a way of breaking free from the darkness of the mines and the religious life that held him in Borinage. He was reaching unconsciously for something concrete to hold onto—confirmation, perhaps, of the dawning of his call to art.<br/><br/>When he finally got to Courrieres, he could not get himself to enter Breton&apos;s home: &quot;for I lacked the courage to enter and introduce myself.&quot; Reflecting on his journey to Theo, he wrote: &quot;Well, even in that deep misery I felt my energy revive, and I said to myself, in spite of everything I shall rise again: I will take up my pencil, which I have forsaken in my great discouragement, and I will go on with my drawing. From that moment everything has seemed transformed for me, and now I have started, and my pencil has become somewhat docile, becoming more so every day.” He never would return to the Borinage. Only through memory and on canvas. <br/>This was the birth of Vincent van Gogh. <br/>____________<br/>Vincent van Gogh, ”Coalmine in the Borinage” (1880)<br/>Jules Breton, ”The Song of the Lark” (1884)</p>]]></content:encoded>

The topic of the evening was China, or rather, Mao Zedong. The Sino-American relationship at this point in history was at its nadir, with zero active diplomatic channels operating between the two powers. However, the capstone of the Nixon administration’s policy of détente was the liberalization of Sino-American relations. To achieve this grand plan, Nixon turned to America’s most erudite military and academic advisors to develop help develop a successful agenda for the planned February visit between him and Chairman Mao Zedong. After multiple sessions between Nixon and his advisors, Henry Kissinger and Nixon realized that a gap in their effort existed, namely, an esoteric diplomat. <br/>__________<br/>China, during the middle of the twentieth century, shed its traditional neo-Confucian skin and grew its contemporary epidermis of communist, “hard” humanism thanks to Mao Zedong. The character, the modus operandi, of the Chinese people and her social-political trajectory laid in the hands of Mao Zedong. Mao’s tenure as Chairman of the Communist Party was a classic epic performed in a Weberian theater. One man who understood the gravity of Nixon’s planned meeting with Mao Zedong was Malraux. Malraux had met with Mao on multiple occasions when the leader was both a radical leader in the communist intelligentsia and as Chairman. He knew Mao on a personal level; thus, his insight was esoteric but sacred in the world of rising cities and dying gods. <br/>__________<br/>André Malraux told Nixon on the eve of his trip: “You are about to attempt one of the most important things of our century. I think of the sixteenth-century explorers, who set out for a specific objective but often arrived at a totally different discovery. You have the destiny of the world in your hands.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

Most of the visitors refused to partake in such an act, but this did not stop a few visitors from pressing the button.<br/><br/>The moralists, voyeurs, and sadists present at the exhibit represent Western society. We in the West are in a nascent state. Yet, we peripatetically maneuver our lives anyway, hoping something will stick and someone will notice. I can’t decide whether or not the moralist and the voyeur differ, since both become sclerotic by pleasure when faced with taking action. What is certain though is the latent sadism that lurks within us. I know Freud stated that human sadomasochism and barbarism remains in the unconscious thanks to Western civilization’s ability to thwart the attenuation of social decorum. But who are we kidding? Civilization is an archaic device whose utterance calls foregone faces and ages to mind, not the present age defined by schadenfreude and decadence.<br/><br/>Civilization is defined by the art it produces. This is why André Malraux once said: “We do not mind a Rembrandt looking modern, but we resent a modern painting looking like a Rembrandt.” Malraux’s point is that by painting to describe the past, instead of painting to explore the present, the painter is imposing a false image to the viewer.<br/><br/>Evaristti’s work is ultimately an exploration of the present state of civilization: a people filled with ideas and colors, but without a canvas to explore. This is a credible and compelling work of contemporary art.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But in 2008, even after Jon Favreau’s “Iron Man” birthed the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe that same summer, superhero cinema was not accorded much artistic pedigree. However, this dark Batman sequel scored critically, garnering eight Oscar nominations and winning two, including Heath Ledger’s hauntingly iconic performance as the Joker. <br/>___________<br/><br/>The Joker was expressive with his eyes, and his voice had undulations of irony and mockery that added a ring of psychopathology to his character. His capricious nature was exemplified by his constant licking of the lips, but a deeper reading could be that his parapraxic “slip of the tongues” was Nolan’s clever attempt to tap into audience’s unconscious. <br/>___________<br/><br/>Without Ledger’s performance, I doubt we would lionize “The Dark Knight” as we now do.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Following the attack, the government revoked the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status given to Pakistan and also imposed a 200% customs duty on all imported goods. <br/>Under the Indus Water Treaty, which was signed in 1960, the western rivers-  the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab- was given to Pakistan and those of the eastern rivers- the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej- to India. Most of Pakistan’s water comes from these three rivers. The Modi administration insists that the stopping of its share of western water from going to Pakistan is in no way a violation of the landmark 1960 treaty. <br/>Have the Water Wars begun?</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Pahlavi family had been seen as a pillar of regional stability and a bulwark of US influence against the Soviet Union in Central Asia. But after centuries of Qajar and Pahlavi modernization efforts, Iran was ripe for an insurrection against the Pahlavi government which was the totem of Western influence. <br/>The Revolution was one of the most important events of not only the twentieth century but of world history. For two millennia, Persia was ruled by Shahs whose legitimacy was rooted in brute usurpation of power. But with Khomeini’s declaration of an Islamic Republic protected by the auspices of the Shia faith, he closed a chapter in Persian history and wrote a new one. Iran now stands as the most dominant theocracy in the world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

When asked why he chose to refrain from allowing the viewer to see “the face” in his works, he responded: “Everything we see hides another thing, we always want to see what is hidden by what we see. There is an interest in that which is hidden and which the visible does not show us. This interest can take the form of a quite intense feeling, a sort of conflict, one might say, between the visible that is hidden and the visible that is present.” Magritte’s cogent answer is a rare example of an artist’s intentionality. One of Picasso’s trademark characteristics was his cryptic, pithy remarks to those who asked him what his art meant. This reply allows us to look deeper into his avant-style, Shéhérazade. <br/>The style, named after the female protagonist in “One Thousand and One Nights,” is said to have been influenced by Edgar Allen Poe’s short story, “The Thousand-and-Second Tale of Scheherazade.” Poe’s story begins with the quotable phrase: “Truth is stranger than fiction.” What Magritte gathered from Poe’s work is that the truth of seeing a face reveals minimal insight into what lies beneath the skin. Fiction grants us the opportunity to imagine new possibilities which truth’s finitude fails to offer. When we look at Magritte’s art, we are actively involved in the search for what is “not” there, just as the king in “One Thousand and One Nights” fell in love with Scheherazade since she represented what was not present in his life: the infinite beauty of fiction.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I happened to come across his 1951 classic “Bill Mauldin’s Army” a few months back while sauntering the aisles of a used book store. The prescience of his cartoons was the first thing I noticed while flipping through the dusty book. Here’s an example of what I mean. This was published in 1941. The past is now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is not entirely Moroccan in body and soul either. It is a whitewashed city of of sidewalk cafes and fine restaurants with bazaars where you can bargain for carpets and hand-painted plates or just lose yourself among sacks of spices and knock-off Hermes products. However, on this day in 1943, Casablanca was the site of a momentous, ten-day conference which altered the course of the Second World War. _<br/><br/>The sun beat fiercely on the attendees at the Anfa Hotel. Mr. Churchill asked President Roosevelt, &quot;Do you want a hat?&quot; &quot;I was born without a hat,” Mr. Roosevelt replied. Churchill and Roosevelt were joined by Charles de Gaulle and Henri Giraud who represented France under German occupation. For the next ten days, the men deliberated war plans over liquor and cigars. Joseph Stalin could not attend the conference. He instead was rallying the Russian people at Stalingrad. On the final day of the Conference, President Roosevelt announced that he and Churchill had decided that the only way to ensure postwar peace was to adopt a policy of unconditional surrender. The President clearly stated, however, that the policy of unconditional surrender did not entail the destruction of the populations of the Axis powers but rather, “the destruction of the philosophies in those countries which are based on conquest and the subjugation of other people.” _<br/><br/>Casablanca, neither ancient nor truly Moroccan, will go down in history as one of the pivotal “Twentieth Century Cities.” Think Berlin, Moscow, Washington, D.C., Hanoi, and Havana. These are the cities where the graveyards of the previous century lie. Buried are the edifices, relics, and figures that shaped the most consequential century in human history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, this is not a picture from the Blitz. <br/>It’s August 15, 1969. For two days, Northern Ireland was at war. Tear-gas filled the streets. Make-shift incendiary cocktails bursted through storefront windows and living rooms, setting Derry ablaze in urban holocaust. Gun shots echoed throughout the night. The youth rioted in the streets by day and took to the rooftops by night. On the third day, hundreds of police officers, Irish youth, Catholic priests, and soldiers lie dead in solemn stillness.<br/>This was the beginning of The Troubles. <br/>Across the Atlantic, it was the first day of Woodstock. •••••••••••••••<br/>“There&apos;s a battle outside<br/>And it is ragin&apos;.<br/>It&apos;ll soon shake your windows<br/>And rattle your walls<br/>For the times they are a-changin.&apos;”<br/>-Bob Dylan.</p>]]></content:encoded>

If you count out tabloids, it&apos;s the 2nd most read newspaper. In 2014, it was voted the most opinion-forming medium of the decade in Poland. The editorial team is made of 150 people and it&apos;s online edition is also well known and cited. Despite these credentials, the Chinese government has managed to wiggle its propaganda into the newspaper. <br/>The ad kinda looks like a regular article, but is marked as an advertisement at the top. The ad doesn&apos;t have a clear author and its language is subpar compared to typical articles in Rzeczpospolita. It promotes Xi Jinping as a great reformer, improving China in a way enhancing general prosperity among all people in China, winning war against corruption, earning trust of citizens, and saving the environment.<br/>This is part of a much larger, well orchestrated global propaganda operation by China, as outlined in a December 7th, 2018 article published in the Guardian. Though it does bear the disclaimer: &quot;The content is produced and published by China Daily, People&apos;s Republic of China, which takes sole responsibility for its contents&quot;, the fact that they agreed to publish the Communist Party&apos;s propaganda carte blanche should be raising alarm bells.<br/>Sadly, many leading global dailies have abdicated their journalistic responsibility in the face of lucrative deals with the Chinese Communist Party.</p>]]></content:encoded>

But “woman” is hardly a universal constant. In previous posts, I have shared art that depicts the sculpture of woman and not the mere outline of women. Great art is produced when an artist creates what is thought to be there, not what is there. In this work, woman is the balancing rock. One fateful move and the rocks collapse. Physically strong, yet eternally fragile.  The woman, naked and insouciant, smiles at us because she knows the truth. She does not need anyone. We need her. That’s why her body is slightly contorted. Half looking back, half already moving away because she is not waiting on anyone. Her hand is there, all we have to do is reach out and hold it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Such gory public execution was common in the late 18th century. The grotesque acts were symbolic for the French during the Revolution as the representation of despotism. Take the execution of François-Jean de la Barre in 1766. He had his tongue ripped off with a pincher, he was beheaded, and his body was burnt. Why? He forgot to remove his hat during a religious procession. When King Louis and Queen Antionette were sent to the guillotine by the French people, Damiens and la Barre were given justice.</p>]]></content:encoded>

However, his membership card according to Neil Cox, author of The Picasso Book, shows he joined on September 1, 1944. Coincidentally, the U.S. Army&apos;s 28th Infantry Division had just entered Paris and marched down the Champs Elysees on August 29, 1944. Andre Breton, the father of surrealism, would never shake Picasso&apos;s hands saying, “It&apos;s smeared with the shit of too many dictators.” _________<br/>As early as 1945, J. Edgar Hoover ordered agents in the newly reopened American Embassy in Paris to keep an eye on Picasso. In a memorandum dated Jan. 16, 1945, one of the key documents in what is now known as the “Picasso Dossier”, Hoover wrote: “In the event information concerning Picasso comes to your attention, it should be furnished to the Bureau in view of the possibility that he may attempt to come to the United States.&quot; What initially turned Hoover&apos;s attention to Picasso, according to that document, was a statement written by the artist in 1944, called &quot;Why I Became a Communist.&quot; It reads, in part: &quot;My joining the Communist Party is a logical step in my life, my work and gives them meaning. Through design and color, I have tried to penetrate deeper into a knowledge of the world and of men so that this knowledge might free us. In my own way I have always said what I considered most true, most just and best, and therefore, most beautiful. But during the oppression and the insurrection I felt that that was not enough, that I had to fight not only with painting but with my whole being. . . .&quot; In 1950 Picasso contemplated a trip to the United States. His file contains a report from The Washington Post, dated March 4 of that year, noting that the State Department had refused to permit a 12-member European &quot;peace delegation,&quot; headed by Picasso, to visit the United States. The Picasso group was formally called the World Congress of Partisans of Peace, and the State Department branded it the &quot;leading Communist-front organization in the world,&quot; adding that the 12 members &quot;are either known Communists or fellow travelers and are therefore subject to exclusion.&quot;</p>]]></content:encoded>

He lived in his own luxury studio, now called le Grenier Picasso, in Montmartre during the entire German occupation of Paris doing society portraits of German officers’ wives and selling landscapes to General Choltitz, the military governor. Meanwhile, artists like Max Jacob, Tina Morpurgo and Adolphe Féder were sent to their deaths at Auschwitz and Banjica. The entire &apos;No, you did&apos; story is also entirely the product of Picasso’s own recollection of the wartime years. <br/>_____________<br/>&quot;Picasso is a painter, so am I. Picasso is a Spaniard, so am I. Picasso is a communist, neither am I.” -Salvador Dalí</p>]]></content:encoded>

I investigate this story further in another post. <br/>_______<br/>The artwork started weeks after German and Italian bombers unleashed an early dose of Blitzkreig on the Basque town from which the work takes its name, Gernika. The attack, which took place on April 26, 1937, leveled three-quarters of the historic town, killing hundreds of the roughly 6,000 people who lived in the city. The bombing was one of the first air raids against a defenseless civilian population. It was first shown at the World Fair in Paris, supposedly a showcase for scientific progress, but the deaths of hundreds of civilians in a small Spanish town proved technology’s darker side.<br/>_______ <br/>A full-size tapestry copy of Guernica is hung at the United Nations in New York City at the entrance to the Security Council room. During the months leading up to the 2003 Iraq War, a curtain was placed over the work so that it would not be visible in the background while Colin Powell presented intelligence used to justify invading Saddam’s Iraq.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Left, a revolt against neoliberalism. Both are right. Over the last three decades especially, publicly funded schools, hospitals, and train lines have closed down since the government can no longer provide the necessary support for these cherished public goods. Rural France is not like rural America. The countryside has been a symbol of national identity for the French who used the soil as a means for self-sufficiency during the Great Depression and an intransigent abode against the Vichy and German governments who occupied their cities during the Second World War. Millions of people moved to the countryside during this period and chose to stay during the economic modernization of France during the derigisme program. The most common way for rural French workers to get to the cities for employment was publicly funded transportation. However, this safety net has eroded precipitously since the government chooses to give tax breaks to major corporations. With the loss of much needed tax revenue from corporations, the government has increased taxes on the working class who have no capacity to handle higher taxes. The last lifeline for poor, rural French citizens was their ability to find work far from home and being able to afford transportation to and from work. Having a car and being able to afford fuel are lifelines for these people who no longer can rely on public transportation. To bring more revenue into the government, President Emmanuel Macron announced his austere gas tax to pay down the growing deficit he vowed to fix during his 2016 campaign. Here are some facets of the tax: older vehicles (the most commonly owned vehicles of rural workers) will be taxed more to encourage people to buy newer vehicles, the older vehicles will lose the right to be driven on polluted days due to traffic on highways, and diesel, the gas for older vehicles, will be taxed more. Macron raised taxes on those who could least afford them. Macron now lost the people he needs most for his re-election in these times of populist angst.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This was a working-class, grassroots movement against President Macron’s economic policies. To help curb carbon emissions, Macron introduced in January of this year a tax on gas that was projected to add four euro cents to a liter for unleaded gas and seven euro cents for diesel. However, the price of gas has risen dramatically, meaning that French drivers, this fall, found themselves paying as much as 1.59 euros per liter, which is an increase of seventeen percent since this time last year for users of unleaded gas, and twenty-three percent for diesel. Jacqueline Mouraud, an accordionist from Brittany who has become a de facto spokesperson for the movement, vented her frustration with an exasperated, folksy refrain: “But what are you doing with French people’s money?” The gilets jaunes began as a driver&apos;s movement, hence the name yellow jackets (i.e., French drivers are required to keep them in their cars). However, it became more volatile over the course of this past week as international media began to cover the protests. All across Paris, the protestors trashed some of the city’s most famous, heavily touristed areas—the Tuileries, Opera, the Champs-Élysées.  Most unthinkably, the marchers breached the Arc de Triomphe, spray-painting the monument with slogans such as “Macron Démission” (“Macron Resignation”). According to some polls, around eighty percent of French people are sympathetic to the gilets jaunes. But I don&apos;t know who conducted the polls, so caveat emptor. Movements like this can be easily swayed towards demagoguery and fringe political groups. Macron vowed to stay the course without ceding to demagogy. However, with today&apos;s announcement that France will suspend their gas tax for six-months, Macron validated that popular unrest is successful. The European Parliamentary elections are coming up in May. Macron must know that the principles of his 2016 campaign, namely, globalism, centrism, and environmentalism, will be put to the ultimate test. The people have won, but will they stop here?</p>]]></content:encoded>

Christmas lights, Hanukkah candles, glowing embers in the fireplace. Before this season begins and ends in the blink of an eye, I want to reflect on its ephemerality and it’s importance. <br/>Take this image. The trees stand with placid water at its feet. During the year, the two fluctuate in varying degrees together. At summer’s pinnacle, the trees form a plump, green forest that house tiny creatures and invite curious wanderers to its watery shore. At winter’s nadir, the endoskeleton of the forest is revealed. The trees begin to look uncanny without its leaves that form the forest’s epidermis. The shore that invites visitors and creatures freezes and the forest remains stoically silent until the season changes. Each year, autumn sweeps through this forest and fades the green leaves into hues of yellow, red, and orange. Those hues streak across the skies and waters, creating a surreal scene. <br/>We stop to appreciate the leaves as they change colors because it symbolizes a break from the tedium. The tedium manifests in the green forest, the suburban home, the quiet street, the everyday routine of life. But as the season of the lights approaches, we shift focus and marvel at the colorful lights that adorn our homes, our quiet blocks, and ultimately, our lives. The Christmas lights, the Hanukkah candles, and the glowing fire embers create a resplendent layer to life that we can observe and an endogenous layer of light that we internalize throughout life in varying degrees like the trees and water. Just as the varying hues of the forest amazes us, the season of lights makes us marvel at the beauty of life. If the season of lights were a year-long ordeal, it would wane in its effect and become just like the green forest, the suburban home, the quiet street, the everyday routine of life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In between this intersection is us, the viewers. <br/>Harold Cohen passed away on April 27, 2016. He was 87. Over a career that spanned more than 60 years, he exhibited work around the world in dozens of exhibitions. His works are held in major museums like the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum in London, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and the Tate Gallery. Commenting on Cohen’s passing, the computer artist Frieder Nake said: “Harold was the lonesome rock of rule-based algorithmic art. Nobody in the world did anything in fine art as courageous, as daring, and as successful as he. His approach was unique in all its facets. His rich work stands out unparalleled.”<br/>______________________________<br/><br/>For modern computer art, check out @robbie.exe</p>]]></content:encoded>

Mr. Bloomberg intends for his donation to be used for financial aid so that admissions will be permanently needs-blind. From his New York Times op-ed: “Hopkins has made great progress toward becoming ‘need-blind’ — admitting students based solely on merit. I want to be sure that the school that gave me a chance will be able to permanently open that same door of opportunity for others. And so, I am donating an additional $1.8 billion to Hopkins that will be used for financial aid for qualified low- and middle-income students.” Many now hope this gesture of philanthropy will be a bellwether for future donations from other billionaires to advance meritocratic admissions. <br/>________________________<br/>“Wise men plant trees whose shade they will not see.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

It&apos;s the southern states, Utah and parts of Idaho.<br/><br/>Forty-eight of the 50 counties whose residents gave the highest proportion of their income to charity in 2013 were located in those areas, according to recently released IRS figures detailing itemized tax returns. Several of the counties reporting the highest rates of giving are in impoverished areas of Mississippi, Texas and Alabama.<br/><br/>Religion likely plays a big role in explaining the numbers. A large proportion of charitable giving in those places goes to churches. Residents in Utah and Idaho, home to large Mormon populations, and the South, a center for evangelical Christians, are encouraged from the pulpit to tithe, the practice of giving 10 percent of one&apos;s income to church.</p>]]></content:encoded>

During the war, attacks were almost always carried out in daylight. When daylight touched the battlefields at 8 a.m., American and French forces carried out one final assault against Germany despite the signing of the Armistice. At 11 a.m., the final shots rung out amid the screams of wounded American and German troops who just thirty minutes earlier had unleashed the final gas attack of the war. Diaries from U.S. soldiers of the 92nd Battalion recount their final charge through mustard gas with bayonets fixed at 11:30 a.m. When 11 a.m. hit, the men heard sirens signaling the end of the war. Some men finished off their former enemy as they lied their helpless. Others just dropped their weapons and helped their wounded friends who would soon succumb to the poisonous toxins in their lungs. From 5 a.m. to 11 a.m., 3,000 men died along with 11,000 wounded in a fight that took place technically after the First World War ended. The day’s toll was greater than both sides would suffer in Normandy on D-Day, 1944. The war ended as senseless as it began.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While at the Tribune, Marx authored over 400 articles which dealt with various topics such as the everyday life of British workers, the Crimean War, Italian unification, and juicy financial scandals in France. Marx left the Tribune to work at the Viennese newspaper Die Presse and focus solely on the extraordinary conflict unfolding across the Atlantic, the U.S. Civil War. Marx was an enthusiastic supporter of the Union and wrote to Lincoln through the London-based International Workingmen’s Association in 1864 to congratulate Lincoln on his re-election and reinforce his support of the Union’s war against slavery. A little-known fact is that Marx had thought of immigrating to Texas. In 1843, he went so far as to apply for an immigration permit at the mayor’s office in Trier, Germany. Marx wrote “American Soil and Communism” in 1844, an article that praised land reform proposals and the republican institutions of the United States. As for the picture here, we see Lincoln’s view on labor and capital; a view which Marx praised.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His provocative proclamations of revolution against the Gaullist government struck a chord amongst the students of Paris. On one occasion, Bendit invited the German professor Karl Dietrich Wolff to speak to the student protestors. News got out of Wolff’s invitation and he was soon denounced by France’s state-run press as a &quot;Jew, a German, and an undesirable.&quot; People were stunned by the attacks levied against Bendit. Art became the medium through which protestors expressed their politics. The immediate artistic response was to create this poster. Thousands flooded the streets chanting the slogan found on the poster - &quot;We Are All Undesirables!&quot; This type of artistic atavism is unknown today. We rally around the photograph, they rallied around the art.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><video controls><source src="https://auzaren.github.io/malleable-brains-ig-claude/media/posts/201810/17978559298073683.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p><p>Ludwig Feuerbach is on my mind. He wrote a book in 1841 called The Essence of Christianity. I guess the book was successful enough to earn him the coveted privilege of having his last name alone represent an edifice of his ideas. “Oh, Feuerbach? In The Essence of Christianity, he claimed that our conception of God is a projection of human subjectivity. To justify life, humans need values. So we created a grand objectifier to protect values that kept men civil and women subservient. Thus, we created God in our image. Not the other way around.” See what I just did there? The last name evoked all that. If I say your last name, what will people say about you? What’s your philosophy? Dreaming big and sleeping late? If I were you, I’d go for the catchy epithet on the grave. Having an eponym like Orwell or Pavlov stick is hard. You need to leave behind something tasty enough for the future empty stomachs to gobble up. Feuerbach stated that “Man is what he eats.” This was supposed to be a critique of materialist culture and religious orthodoxy. But now we tell kids “You are what you eat.” We do this to get them to eat their asparagus and stay away from the foods that they will one day inevitably learn are genuinely better than sex and makes you happy. There’s no green in his park. Only in memory. I can’t believe the season is changing already. The seasons prove to us that although everything changes, nothing changes. We are still a hungry species despite being banished from Eden. We are still hungry for a higher being despite centuries of death over the ownership of religious truth. Is the truth not right here in this park? A summer lives within all of us, but we live in the shadows of a bitter winter. Looking to a future summer for salvation from the winter has been pursued by many hungry Adam and Eves. The problem is that they got tired of tasting apples but were still hungry. The eternal summer is there. Just remember that the leaves always return and it’s good to be hungry for more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

He proposed that this building would serve as a correctional facility led by a hidden, omnipresent guardian who observed inmates’ behavior and character without the inmates’ knowing when or how they were being watched. The purpose of this system was to incentivize inmates to regulate their own behavior. If they follow the rules, they will not be punished. However, if one defiant inmate chooses to disrupt the social order, the guardian would punish the inmate at random by taking away social privileges or by physical punishment. This hidden authority figure was in the center of the building positioned in a watch tower. In Bentham’s words: “Morals reformed, health preserved, industry invigorated, instruction diffused, public burthens lightened, economy seated, as it were, upon a rock—the Gordian Knot of the poor law not cut, but untied all by a simple idea in Architecture!” In the Panopticon, there is no autonomous individual. Any sense of subjective truth is already inscribed by the social institution designed by the omniscient guardian. This hidden guardian controls what one does, what one thinks, and what one desires.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Stalin and Hitler agreed to split Poland along the San, Vistula, and Narew rivers, forming the Curzon Line. What is often not included in accounts of this invasion is that the Soviets and Germans both unilaterally broke non-aggression pacts with Poland (i.e. The German-Polish Pact was signed in 1934 and the Soviet-Polish Pact was signed in 1932). The pacts were heralded by Britain and France as concrete steps towards rectifying territorial settlement disputes between Germany and Eastern Europe caused by the Versailles Treaty. In 1941, Germany broke their pact with the Soviets by invading the Soviet Union’s western front, known formally as Operation Barbarossa.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Edgar Hoover in notable fashion. Hoover, the first director of the FBI and the incumbent during the McCarthy-era, was widely thought to have been a closeted homosexual. His long time protégée and successor at the Bureau, Clyde Tolson, was considered by historian John Cox (Cox? The irony...) to be Hoover’s secret lover. You can see his detailed investigation into the subject in his 1988 book, The Boss. In a FBI memo dated back to April 1952, you can see a remarkable correspondence between Hoover and Roy Wood, then Assistant Director at the Bureau, which detailed a plan to “vigorously interrogate” a junior-level clerk who was overheard gossiping about Hoover’s private life at a dinner party. The document has blackened-out sections which conceal the names of the men who led the interrogation and the clerk’s name. Nonetheless, the document is a testament to Hoover’s legacy: a gay ogre.</p>]]></content:encoded>

After decades of marriage, a husband says his final goodbye to his best friend and wife, Frances. Seven years later, Walter succumbs to disease and joins his best friend. Four children remain.<br/>It’s 1817. One of the four children of the late Barry couple embarks across the Middle East and Europe. His name is Charles. <br/>It’s 1819. Rome, Italy. Charles is standing in front of the Palazzo Farnese. How such a site still stood firm despite the many winds of history that have entrenched its walls awed into silence Charles. He is met by façades designed by Michelangelo and Sangallo. He walks through a corridor that leads to the West Wing. He enters a room and looks up. Carracci’s tableaux, “The Loves of the Gods,” adorns the ceiling. He twirls upwards towards The Room of Maps, &quot;Sala del Mappamondo.” He observes the cartographic masterpieces before him, reflecting that the stairs transported him physically and spiritually away from Dante’s Inferno and into the world of empires, Aristotle, Hercules, Charles V, the Pope, and Napoleon. Before leaving, he looks back once more at the Palazzo Farnese and thinks, “I too am of this world.”<br/>_______________________<br/><br/>Charles Barry would become an architect upon his return to England after years of travel. With the Palazzo Farnese in his memory, he designed the Reform Club in London with impeccable craftsmanship and respect to the original building. Charles was later commissioned to design the Palace of Westminster where England’s parliament operates today.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You spent your life bow’n to the Almighty. Well I plan on spend’n mine out on the sea! I’m leav’n this town, you just wait and see! You gon’ die alone because of some Almighty decree. But I’ll be traveling free like a bumble bee.”<br/>The preach’a smiled and said he’d pray for me. “And don’t forget this is your home if you just be.” Since then, I traveled many a sea. <br/>Spent some time in the city. <br/>Even have me a nice little fam’ly.<br/>But lately I’ve been feel’n empty. <br/>So I decided to go see my old reality. <br/>My wife told me it reminded her of a still pict’a. <br/>Somethin’ about old towns strike city people as enigma.<br/>Maybe its because we only got one motion pict’a.<br/>Or it could be its supris’n charisma.<br/>When we pass’d the home of the old preach’a,<br/>My kids laughed at it’s old, decrepit feat’a.<br/>I told ‘em to respect that home, <br/>For it was where the preach’a died alone!<br/>He died alone in this old, decrepit home, <br/>And now this house stands to teach ya.<br/>On our drive back to the city, my wife looked at me wit’ pity. “How different that was than the big city!<br/>The school, the church, and the market in such close proximity,<br/>How could anybody live in such propinquity?”<br/>I did not answer because I finally knew what the Lord can teach ya.<br/>Like the old preach’a, <br/>The Lord will not try to keep ya.<br/>He remains still while we venture out for a life of thrill. <br/>And like the preach’a and his old, decrepit home, the Lord choses to be alone so that we may come back home.<br/>If we be, we may no longer feel empty. •</p>]]></content:encoded>

We are now gliding up and away from the ground with the greatest of scientific progress. The greater heights science takes us, the less we comprehend its novelty. But have you ever thought about what would happen if all the escalators stopped working? They would transmogrify back into staircases and we would be forced to re-enter the past. Right? Why do we say the past is lost and the future is now? The past is not lost but is with us now. We just mask it in the name of “progress”. The car is nothing but a horse drawn carriage lacking the Victorian aesthetics and the neighing. The battery is a match. The phone is a religion. Don’t you understand? A phone connects millions of strangers under the guise of truth. Fastest broadband internet connection, unlimited data, innovative features, and access to the latest information are the same marketing ploys of all the great religions. A prophet sells the message, priests continue to market the original message in new and original ways, and the congregation is captured by truth and insularity. We are nothing more than a congregation waiting for our weekly sermon. It’s ringing now but don’t reach for it! Did you agree to live under such feudal rule? Why be a serf when you can be a Lord? Our feudal ancestors would grovel before Kings. They would slave for them, sweat blood for them, and starve for them so that they might be fed. They would work so that they might one day play. Drink misery so that they might taste happiness. Over centuries of duress, they triumphed through progress. But now, with all of their hard-fought progress, we are back to groveling. We cannot afford a second away from relevancy. We struggle to understand happiness but we avoid misery. Maybe experiencing misery leads one to happiness. We play in safe spaces so that we don’t have to do the work towards real progress. Look around you, you are surrounded by our forgotten ancestors. Their future aspirations manifested into us! The past is with us always, no matter how well we try to mask it with progress. We’ve reached the top, but where do we go from here?</p>]]></content:encoded>

All moves have purpose. The rules of the game were handed down to us. But the topic of who created such rules are hardly of any concern to the philistine. Our early mistakes come back to haunt us later in the game. We get caught in check and seek help from an omniscient player watching over our shoulders. The guidance is futile since we are being played by a puppeteer. To be told how to get out of check is a mere fig leaf if one does not rectify their original sin of dependence. Goethe told us that knowing is not enough; we must apply. Apply the previous knowledge from your game of chess and become the learned player. Don’t be the prop of a puppeteer, for you can never experience the art created by your strings. You will always remain a blank canvas waiting for an artist’s stroke to give you life.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The world our ancestors lived and died in. But still, can we not let bygones be? It would be a disservice to those who now lay beneath the very ground they once walked upright on to just let bygones be. The past is unpleasant. The future is envisioned as the progression from the unpleasant. And the present? Mere anticipation that with each graveyard filled by atavistic, miserly generation, society inches closer to a better tomorrow. But what if tomorrow never comes? I fear that we set expectations that are becoming more disillusioned with each passing graveyard. A world without religion would be less monolithic and ideological right? Tell that to the tens of millions that perished last century as you walk over their bodies with your “Enlightened” skepticism of eternal truth. Democracy is the sentinel of Western Civilization. Tell that to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, the founding fathers of the Western tradition who disdained democracy. We need religion. Do we? Or do you? There’s a difference. My eternal truth is quite different from yours. Your Mother Nature is my sister. Nature and I come from the same Father, thus we are united as kin. Your God is a Man, mine is a book. I need religion to speak back to me when I am continuously left questioning without consolation from an indifferent world. If I free myself from my religion, I free myself from my freedom. What is your freedom? Anticipating tomorrow? Living “as if” like Hitchens? A better tomorrow does not exist. The only thing that exists is the past. But the past is now a lost world.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Through this modernization process, nearly 50 millions Chinese citizens perished in state-sponsored famines and executions for the purpose of &quot;leaping&quot; China into the modern world through radical cultural paradigm shifts. What Mao ultimately accomplished through his maniacal rule was establishing a modern Chinese identity rooted in confucianism, communism, and the Chinese nation. Under China&apos;s current leader, Xi Jinping, the Chinese are no longer embroiled with the internal struggles of the cultural revolutions of Mao. Now, the Chinese are faced with the opportunity to right the wrongs caused by the West. They have begun to do this already in Asia with their own version of the Marshall Plan: One Belt-One Road. However, what needs to be spoken broadly about is China&apos;s involvement in Africa. The Chinese military has been building naval and reconnaissance bases along the along Africa&apos;s Horn. China&apos;s largest base is located on Djibouti&apos;s coast line. Djibouti is located next to the Bab-el- Mandeb straight that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. 80% of European sea trade with Asia passes through this straight since it drastically limits the travel time to Asia. Without access to this straight (and the Suez Canal), European trade would suffer. So on one side we have Djibouti and on the other lies Yemen. Yemen is a poor Arab  nation that has been involved in a brutal civil and regional war. Just yesterday, the Yemeni conflict was declared the world&apos;s worst humanitarian crisis. The Houthi rebels constitute one side of the forces. They are a Shiite demographic in Yemen that is currently waging a war against the supports of the nationalist government of Abdrabbuh Hadi. Hadi&apos;s government is supported by Saudi Arabia and the Houthis are supported by Iran. In the second graphic, the red area is Houthi held territory where Al Qaeda and ISIL now operate satellite networks. With control of the Yemeni coast along the Bab-el-Mandeb, that effectively means the straight is been choked by China and Iran.</p>]]></content:encoded>

I found one particular case from the report quite troubling. But first, some boring history. China has been the most monolithic and impenetrable civilization throughout history. Confucian idealism has formed the essentials of modern Chinese culture: filial piety, Ren (i.e. humaneness as a civic virtue), and Lǐ (i.e. universal governance of society). However, when China adopted communism as its new political and social order, the bedrock of confucian idealism faced critical issues that had not been properly addressed for centuries within Chinese society. China had been able to retain its confucian fabrics by not opening up their cultural institutions to European powers during the 17th and 18th centuries. What the Chinese instead chose to was to liberalize their port economy to the British, the French, and the Dutch. Sea trade between China and Europe had the same economic benefits that the silk road had between the two civilizations for centuries. But in both scenarios, cultural mores were not traded along these trade routes enough to constitute any resemblance to the current cultural trade that occurs between all civilizations today. Despite China&apos;s formidability as a culturally homophilous society, their refusal to partake in European mercantile imperialism led to their inability to accrue wealth and technological innovation that put Europe centuries ahead of China developmentally. To over simplify why China chose not to partake in the action, the Chinese leadership believed that the European system went against their cultural order. However, after World War II, millions of Chinese were slaughtered by a Westernized Japanese military power who crushed the Chinese military&apos;s inferior arsenal. To put this into perspective, the Japanese Imperial Army is said to have killed nearly 10 million Chinese soldiers and civilians between 1933-1941. The Japanese lost around 100,000 soldiers in total. By not having modern military equipment and tactics, the Chinese suffered despite their enormous population. In 1949, Mao Zedong founded the People&apos;s Republic of China.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Because who else?<br/>In Divine Comedy, Dante hesitates to enter Hell and asks Virgil, “But I, why thither come, or who concedes it? I am not Aeneas, I am not Paul, Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.&quot; Virgil responds, &quot;If I have well thy language understood, thy soul attainted is with cowardice, which many times a man encumbers. It turns him back from honoured enterprise, as false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.&quot; In my colloquial, Virgil told Dante to grow a pair. Upon returning to Divine Comedy at the ripe age of twenty, I can&apos;t help but see myself as Dante at the fiery Gates of Hell. Each post here is my attempt to rectify our original sin: cowardice. You can travel down Frost&apos;s less traveled road. Or you can travel down mine. Both have unforeseeable ends and that makes all the difference.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Bind me to you and I become blind. God blinded Saul and transformed him into Paul, his most dutiful and vociferous prophet. Despite criticism from others, I defend you. They just don&apos;t understand you. They reject the truth of your salvation that saved me. Despite having lost my past life to our bind, I carry on with you. A new life. Despite blinding me, I still defend and love you. If I don&apos;t defend you, the fear of evanescence consumes me. This is why I don&apos;t hesitate to charge Goliath for you but become powerless when I go against your will. The truth is, you became Goliath, the Leviathan. You swallowed me at sea and now I am stuck inside you. I can only be saved once I am caught, cut open, and have my eyes reach the light of day once again. But if my eyes are opened, will I remain Paul or become Saul once again? For now, I will remain in your belly. My first home. Our only home.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A metaphor should not have to be dissected like a frog in order to decipher its meaning. For example, &quot;time slips through one&apos;s hands like sand&quot; connects the abstract nature of time to a physical experience that we can all relate to. Orwell&apos;s metaphor however is not so discernible because it tackles the phenomena of immediacy. We are permanent bodies in a changing world. Especially nowadays where the news-cycle warps reality into an endless change of events instead of a contemporary state. I chose Rene Magritte&apos;s &quot;The Son of Man&quot; and Edward Hopper&apos;s &quot;Boy and the Moon&quot; since both capture Orwell&apos;s metaphor well. Magritte intended for his work to be his only self-portrait. This struck a nerve in me. Where&apos;s his face? Of course a face exists behind the apple. We know this because we see faces constantly. However, what we really want is to see behind a face. Especially an attractive one. We want to believe that there&apos;s always more than what meets the eye. This is our mechanism for attributing admirable qualities of others to our malleable brains. The observer is drawn towards the man and tries to use our mechanism to ascribe a meaning. But there is no face and thus, no eyes for us to look into. The Son of Man, Magritte himself, you and I, are forced to stand staring at the emptiness of a face while the true grounding of the world, the texture of the rock and the beauty of the ocean and sky are left behind and forgotten. What is in front of his nose is the apple. But in front of ours is a whole scene that we can&apos;t seem to fixate our attention to. Hopper forces us in &quot;Boy and the Moon&quot; to look at a scene with no face. The moon is like an eye in the sky looking with us. Not through us. The moon&apos;s eye does not judge us but invites us to ponder and reflect. However, the eyes of society immediately judge. This is why we put apples in front of our face. We choose apples based on their appearance. They&apos;re tasty for a few bites. But once one nears the pit, the apple loses its allure and is cast aside. Let one reach your pit and if they stay, keep them.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Their names aren’t necessarily important because you won’t remember them anyway. It’s pretty understandable why we don’t remember names. It’s a cost-benefit analysis at the end of the day. But isn’t that sad? Dostoevsky understood names were not important because names are pat. A name is used to make dogs appear less as feces-eating creatures that lick their own crotches and more like members of the family. I digress. The father’s negligence towards his son was not rooted in any ulterior motive. He simply just forgot about him. He was too busy becoming a regular of Parisian brothels and joining the noble French workers of the February revolution in Paris to remember he had a one-year-old child at home. So noble. We can forget about our natural priorities when the allure of vices and adventure appear invariably better than reality. It’s worth noting that Dostoevsky chose a brothel and the French revolutions of 1848 as the two main abodes for the father. The brothel is nature’s den. The halfway house where men unwittingly vegetate in the only place that keeps the world at bay. If women banded together and chose the male path, the world would turn into one huge brothel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The father took place in the revolution and is said to have met the famous Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin while in Paris. The February revolution ultimately failed since the French tradesmen felt their alliance with the petty bourgeois was fruitless. Bakunin arrived in Paris in 1848 after word spread across Europe that the socialist project was going to be firmly planted in French soil. Deeply influenced by Hegelian dialectics and allied with Karl Marx, Bakunin decried the crimes of the Russian Empire against the Polish people. His views landed him in prison where he would spend the majority of his adult years ridden with disease and destitution. Despite his morbid final years, his anarchist idealism spread famously to Spain in the 1930s where the only anarchist insurrection against an incumbent government ever took place in the Western world. The father, the workers of Paris, and Bakunin had one thing in common: they lived “as if.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

It&apos;s individualism. If you think about it, the individualist’s maxim is “Live life full of satire.” Rosa Parks lived as if a black woman could sit in the front of the bus in Jim Crow America. The father lived as if he did not have to take care of his child despite that being his principal role in nature. I write as if anyone will read a three-part series on individualism and anarchy. The individual purposely acts outside of the normative boundaries of his or her society to make a point. We do not cater to the needs of anyone besides ourselves. The community, the Gemeinda, exists within the commune: you. Whether or not you agree with their philosophy or their work, they are the true anarchists. Individuals. This type has many names: original, anarchist, revolutionary, hero. But I like sophomoric. Only a fool could believe they can disrupt the social order. But wisdom comes through experience, a maxim Hermann Hesse taught me in his work Siddhartha: &quot;Wisdom is not communicable. The wisdom which a wise man tries to communicate always sounds foolish. Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be lived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught.&quot; Parks was a hero. Bakunin was an anarchist. The father was sophomoric. Where you and I fit in will only be determined by time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Since 9/11, 6,940 soldiers have died in war. The death count should be 13,880. 6,940 young men and women who lost the lives they were living and the lives they were going to live. <br/>George Orwell, upon his return from his service overseas in the British Imperial Police, began his career as a writer. Orwell witnessed the hanging of a young man in Burma, which he recounted in &quot;A Hanging&quot;: &quot;It is curious, but till that moment I had never realised what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle I saw the mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we are alive.&quot; The mind can process conflict. It has been been present throughout our history. Our society, however, can not. It seems paradoxical because societies are made up of a collective mind. But society is civilized. We are not. The tabula rasa we are allegedly all born with is domesticated by the societal structures that makes one civilized. A glass of merlot in a red cup is not civilized. Wearing jeans to a funeral is not civilized. Says who? Society. Murder is not civilized. Soldiers kill or murder, depending on one&apos;s opinion of a soldier&apos;s purpose. The wars we currently fight are not wars. They are fantasies. The only time foreign wars reach our shores is when a terrorist attacks our society. Besides that, we live normal lives removed from the horrors of war. When the solider returns home, he is no longer a persona grata. He has come back to live his second life but finds that he is a stranger in his homeland. Alone in the arms of loved ones. Alone trying to become civilized once again. How can you close your eyes once they&apos;ve been opened to the truth of our nature?</p>]]></content:encoded>

It was abandoned but for some reason it still felt alive. Maybe it was the light. But upon reflection, what illuminated the chapel was the corporeal nature of my visit. The chapel was me. A masterpiece left to ruin in a world of masterpieces. What was once a chapel for refuge and purpose is now an empty sanctuary for lost souls. I began to question why it is that we&apos;re mortal. Our story, our mortality, has already been spoiled: we die in the end. However, that&apos;s not what bothered me. What bothered me was what kind of story will I leave behind once l pass. The story I want is the story of that French chapel. Built with many hands. Beautiful, inside and out. Whose core is spiritual and whose skin is human. And despite being forgotten by the world, it will come to life in the heart and mind of the lost soul who enters my abandoned chapel.</p>]]></content:encoded>

A man goes to the beach and everything he brings is inflatable. However, the film&apos;s message is not so simple. <br/>Ersatz translates to &quot;substitute.&quot; It&apos;s historical etymology is noteworthy. In World War I, the Ersatz Corps was a division used by the Germans to break down enemy defense lines. The Corps was home to the most inexperienced soldiers, who evidently were the youngest and newest recruits usually between the ages of 16 and 20. Most young men would die within the first month of deployment. Their remains rarely made it back home, since their bodies were far too disfigured to discern who they were. Families were told they died valiantly in battle, but we know their deaths suggests some lives are deemed less valuable. Replaceable. Soldiers were told to stomp over their remains and press on. The film All Quiet on the Western Front captured the short lives of the young German boys of the Ersatz Corps. During World War II, British soldiers found German ersatz goods such as &quot;Ersatzkaffee&quot; which is what we would consider instant coffee. When the British returned home, they began to use ersatz to describe goods that were a substitute form of a superior or more popular good. <br/>Back to the film. Each character was drawn with simple geometric shapes which I believe Sremec purposefully did to represent the clash between Cubist neoclassicism and the popular Dadaist and deconstruction movements after World War I. The man used the ersatz versions of common items one brings to the beach. Thus, our cube man rejected artifice for utilitarian use. Dadaism rejected traditional art forms for original artwork that embraced anti-bourgeois rationality over conservative irrationality which turned young boys into ersatz goods. Replaceable and inherently meaningless. <br/>If you think of it, we use social media as an ersatz version of real social interaction. We wear ersatz clothing to project an external appearance that does not reflect our inner selves. The man in the film valued reality over artifice.<br/><br/>Take 10 minutes and check out this little film.</p>]]></content:encoded>

With anti-trust laws, minimum wage (which is detestable and needs reform), and worker&apos;s rights enshrined and protected by the Square and New Deal legacies, workers have never been more unbounded to the state bureaucracy. Entrepreneurs have created and amassed wealth by the billions under capitalism. Artisans, whose skills became unmarketable in the Industrial Age, now use modern technology created under the umbrella of capitalism to sell and create their work to a global market. Therefore, to use Marx&apos;s name as a nomme de guerre in the fight against capitalism is ultimately fruitless. Marx was a man of his time and his contribution to the world should not be trivialized. We can still read Plato, with pleasure and profit, as an intellectual discipline, for training in rhetoric and argument, as the founding voice of Western philosophy, and for insights into the culture of ancient Greece; but in doing so we do not need to believe that the table on which we write is merely an imperfect representation of the idea of the perfect table that exists in a purely spiritual realm somewhere else. Marx will no doubt continue to be read and written about for much the same reasons.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The Soviet Union, the graveyard of communism, as Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires, collapsed 27 years ago but still evokes revolutionary bravado among the fiercest Starbucks Trotskyists and woefulness among our classroom Che’s. Marx and the Soviet Union will not retreat from the forefront of political, economic, and social discussion because without the two, we may not be having the discussion at all. I’ve written previously that this century will be defined by our search for the next author who will rewrite history to reflect the present and lead humanity into its next chapter. Thus far, Karl Marx has told the best story, and this saddens me. Marx was a man of his time, as we all are. Marx’s vision of Europe was dark and rightfully so, but his vision of the future aimed backwards. Marx’s magnum opus, Capital, when boiled down to my simpler synopsis, is a story that both anachronistic and timeless in its condemnations of capitalism. Two timeless critiques was on the free market economy since its structures are easily manipulated where wealth accrues in the hands of the few and that humans nature’s relentless greed for profit would lead to overproduction of goods by mechanising the workplace and squeezing the wage of the workers. Although Marx’s critiques are quite valid and only an ideological fool would disagree on these outcomes, only an ideological fool would maintain that these critiques are relevant today as they were then. Marx&apos;s theory on economics, when paralleled to the context of his day, I believe drew heavily from European industrialization in the first half of the nineteenth century and which led to the untenable development of an unskilled labor force, quantity over quality production, and mass consumerism.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the paper, Gettier described the flawed reasoning within the argument of known knowledge and knowledge of belief with the famous &quot;(f) John owns a Ford&quot; case. John owns a Ford because I, the viewer, saw him drive by in it on multiple occasions. However, the flawed reasoning in the proposition is that my conclusion that John owns a Ford was based only on previous knowledge that led to my present belief. It could be that John was always seen driving a Ford but it was his wife&apos;s car; thus, John doesn&apos;t own a Ford. Or, the conclusion that John owned a Ford was drawn only because John had the keys to a Ford in his hand and said he owned it. I believed him because why the hell not? He seemed nice. However, could it be that John found the keys on the floor one day and because he was a life-long kleptomaniac, he actually found the Ford and stole it? It&apos;s most likely not true but it&apos;s also just as likely to be true since I will never truly know how he got the car despite all evidence presented to me since I can not fathom John&apos;s intentions and intuitions. <br/>Humans operate on systems of beliefs that construct one&apos;s knowledge. Thus, knowledge is rooted in belief and is inherently subjective.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://auzaren.github.io/malleable-brains-ig-claude/media/posts/201804/17938722472064899.jpg" alt="Post image" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/></p><p>Part Two: <br/>From 1600 to 1900, empires spread global immanence while nationalistic consciousness brewed within their own de facto borders as peasants and owners began their centuries-long feud in forming the modern capitalist-nation state system. However, those three centuries also began to increasingly see the emerging Western individual who valued liberty and freedom of religion, property, and politics.<br/>From 1900 to the present, humanity has now moved on from creating God in their image and now chooses to create ideas in their image. Two world wars that left over 100 million dead and an invisible war that demolished sovereignty, challenged morality, and ended history as Fukuyama put it, the present times are forcing many to look backwards because Age of Faith and Exploration has left many of us in the Age of Meaning. Duchamp&apos;s submission to the Society of Independent Artists in 1917, &quot;Fountain,&quot; pictured here captures this new Age of Meaning perfectly. Is this a urinal or fountain? Duchamp posed this question to capture the essence of what art should return to: subjective meaning. <br/>Duchamp was influenced by Romantic artists from the 18th century who produced work purely for representing art as an abstract product of the mind and not a institutionalized product for the state. <br/>The sea was once the arena for humanity to find themselves but has now increasingly become a place where we look for ourselves. We are trapped by all and bounded by nothing, and this is why art is our escape and our context. Ronald Barthes declared the author&apos;s death, the individual, just as Nietzsche declared mankind&apos;s first author&apos;s death in 1882: God. Now we are author-less and this age will be our journey of finding our next author.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Picasso called art theft. I call art context.<br/>If you remember back to my last post, I stressed the importance of art as a visual aid to historians who wish to write history journalistically or as a story. In this post, I want to further explore this idea by telling a narrative of history thus far with five paintings: Rembrandt’s “The Storm at the Sea of Galilee,” Leutze’s “Washington Crossing the Delaware,” Friedrich’s “Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog,” and Bartlett’s “The Watercolorist.”<br/>Up until the 20th century, art has served primarily for two purposes: to glorify religion and the state. The glorification of religion in art began after the fall of Rome in the fifth century which plunged Western Europe into a period Petrarch characterized best as the cultural darkness that filled in the absence of Rome as the metropole of the world. Medieval Europe reified religion rather superciliously to adhere to Augustine’s message to purify oneself for the City of God while trapped in the City of Man. Throughout the Medieval Ages, ca. 500-1500, magnificent artwork with Jesus being coronated as the center of the triptych in Eastern European Christian art and as the child of God who symbolized Western Europe’s rebirth after Rome’s collapse. The Holy Roman Emperor and all preceding and successive monarchs during this period embraced a divine right to sovereignty which was bestowed to God first and then to the King and the Pope who served as incumbent divinities while God “spoke” to them.<br/>However, once the Age of Exploration began, the Age of Faith ceased as explorers ventured into far flung lands and encountered new topographies, new cultures, and new freedoms that the heavily Christianized Europe evidently lacked. The Age of Exploration, the Modern period (ca. 1500-1900) began an untenable movement against the axioms of religion and state that Martin Luther and the printing press brought to unimaginable depths. I think of this period as time in which God ceased to create Man in his image and Man began to create God in their image.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Take these two for example: one is a painting of the Parthenon in classical Greece and the other is  photograph of the Parthenon as it stands today. Really pay attention to the details and think about how each made you feel about the focus of the works: the Parthenon. <br/>Nietzsche wrote that all philosophy had fallen forfeit to history. I&apos;d like to add that all history has fallen forfeit to reality. The Parthenon of today is a synecdoche of the classical period. The Parthenon of the past was Western Civilization&apos;s greatest metropole. It&apos;s not so important that classical Greece existed, because one can argue that it never existed. Were you there when Pericles delivered his Funeral Oration? Were you there when Plato&apos;s Academy opened? No, and this removes you from the a posteriori experience that Kant said leads one to pure reason. The only important takeaway from studying the history of classical Greece is that you can have faith in its existence. Without faith, reality supercedes and history falls victim to the relativism of an a posteriori outlook of the world. <br/>My faith in the historical importance of the Parthenon is restored in paintings like this. This painting will forever capture the history of classical Greece and my faith in it&apos;s existence.</p>]]></content:encoded>

While Italians revived and re-applied Greco-Roman architecture, law, and logic to their society, they anathematized Greco-Roman politics for its crude, antediluvian nature. Italian&apos;s believed that political absolutism, nepotism, and major European wars were byproducts of Greco-Roman politics. The solution to Europe&apos;s political and social turmoil of the 14th and 15th centuries was to have governments disenfranchise old ideologies of politics and economics and create new ones like capitalism &amp; mercantilism, both of which were harbingers of the Great Divergence. <br/>Machiavelli instead saw Greco-Roman politics as a transcendent and fundamental guide to leading city-states. His most famous work, The Prince, served as the antithesis to the political revisionism of the Renaissance period which he believed was creating a new generation of leaders who lacked civic leadership. In his work, Machiavelli chose a  leader who he revered as the model of civic leadership, Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, or Cincinnatus. <br/>Cincinnatus was a Roman statesman who, in his old age, retired to go work on his small farm. However, his retirement would be cut short when Rome was attacked by a tribe called the Aequi, who destroyed a Roman army sent to stop them. Senators came to Cincinnatus and asked him to assume the role of Dictator to lead Rome against the Aequi. Cincinnatus humbly accepted, leading an army to soundly defeat the Aequi and stop the threat. Now, as Dictator, he acted to first disband his army and then relinquish his absolute control, electing to return to his farm. He would assume this role once more when a wealthy Roman declared himself King and threatened the Republic. Both times he assumed power, reclaimed stability, and gave back the power to the Roman people. <br/>We should not forget Cincinnatus.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It just unfolds as you go. Driving with no where to go and hopping out of your car in a foreign place is adventurous. Walking the city streets you&apos;ve walked a thousand times with a plan is not really adventurous. Hopping off the subway at a random stop or hopping in a taxi and getting out at any random point is adventurous. Walking into a store that you would never think about going into and looking around is adventurous. <br/>What I am getting at here is that spontaneity is absent in our society. We go from A to B to C and that&apos;s it. The thought of going from A to Z is absurd! <br/>Okay, so what&apos;s the plan when we get there? Why does there need to be a plan when life is so unpredictable? <br/>I can&apos;t tell you what will happen five minutes from now or 5 years from now. Your life can completely change in seconds, so are you really content with the way your life is going now?<br/>Why don&apos;t you switch it up and do something you are not used to. Go to a nature preserve and walk around. Go to the local train station and hop on and get off somewhere you&apos;ve never been before. Say hi to more strangers. Read a book. Get in a fight. Tell someone you love them. Whatever floats your boat.<br/>Life is unpredictable, so do something that people would hear and say, &quot;Wait, what? You did that?&quot; Stop being so fucking boring is what I&apos;m saying! Your life is just a story in the end... make it a good one.</p>]]></content:encoded>

His other works show burning cities with demons and skeletons, abandoned homes, and anachronistic placements of modern infrastructures in a dismal world.  Here, we have a lone traveler who is looking for something. You can decide what he&apos;s looking for, but it&apos;s clear that he is surrounded by death. <br/>Aren&apos;t we all lone travelers surrounded by death? Death is above the traveler, not eye to eye. Death always looms over us even when we can&apos;t see it. I like to think that the statue in the back is holding the clock that is counting down the traveler&apos;s life until his final breath. <br/>I think we are all at war with death. We have to fight to keep on going physically and mentally because when we begin to give up the fight, we already welcome in death. <br/>I relate to this little dude in some weird way and that&apos;s why I love art.</p>]]></content:encoded>

When we are not able to see rocky rivers, sprawling fields full of vegetation or flowers, or just a humongous mountain that nearly touches the clouds, we rely on sentences that beautifully capture those pictures for us.This past weekend, I went to Vermont and was able to see all of the images I just described in person and I had many of my nerdy, &quot;who the hell thinks of this shit,&quot; kind of moments. <br/>While driving on route 30, which runs parallel to the river in the picture, I saw a sign for a town called Jamaica that said it was founded in the 1700&apos;s. While driving through the town I thought of how crazy it is that I&apos;m driving a car, listening to satellite radio and people used to ride horses for transportation and sing songs when they wanted to listen to music. <br/>Then the Romans came to my mind. We think of the Romans as these demagogues of the ancient world (and the Greeks) and it&apos;s almost like we forget these people looked at the same sun and moon we look at. What blows my mind is that the Romans look at the Egyptians how we look at the Romans. One day, people will look at us the same way we look at the Romans. <br/>What&apos;s going to make us so much more complex than any other civilization that historians have ever studied is that there are no gaps in humanity now. <br/>The Fertile Crescent was where shit went down in the ancient world. The gap in humanity during this time is that we had no idea what humans were doing during this time period in other parts of the world. Now, everywhere is like the Fertile Crescent. We have an almost entirely connected world. Technologically through social media, geopolitically from politics, and geographically from science.<br/><br/>With all the innovation and progress humanity has achieved so far, we forget about nature. Transcendentalists wanted to bring nature back into our lives after decades of industrial revolution. The poet William Wordsworth wanted us to know that materialism takes us away from nature. And now here I am, a nobody, living in 2016, writing this on a smartphone.<br/><br/>Nature is cool. You should check it out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

December 8th, 1941.  On the day after Pearl Harbor, a Japanese shop owner hung the sign &quot;I AM AN AMERICAN&quot; in the window of his store. A year later, his store was shut down and sold due to Roosevelt&apos;s Order 9066 that allowed the physical removal of all Japanese Americans into internment camps by the US government. <br/>At the time, the public saw this Order fit for the time period. But looking back now, many consider this event to be one of America&apos;s darkest moments. If you scratch a liberal, a fascist will bleed. Well isn&apos;t that the truth. Fear brings out the worst in humanity. <br/>Do I think Roosevelt was wrong for rounding up the Japanese? No, because if I was an 18 year old in 1941, I would have most likely supported this because nationalism was through the roof. In 2016, the thought of violating any group of people&apos;s human rights like this troubles me and I would publicly denounce it. <br/>A cool side note, 14,000 Japanese Americans were selected from the camps they were put into and formed most of the 442nd Infantry Division. They became the most decorated division in American military history. They earned 9486 Purple Hearts, 8 Presidential Unit Citations, and 21 Medal of Honors.<br/>(@joe_delvicario)</p>]]></content:encoded>

He may die there, but he&apos;s willing to die to help another man in his final moments. <br/>It&apos;s the 1960&apos;s in a politically divided Venezuela, where military coups, public executions, and dead friends and family were apart of life. This priest was offering last rites to soldiers who were critically wounded and most died in his arms crying for mercy. <br/>Mercy for what? For who?<br/>(@joe_delvicario)</p>]]></content:encoded>

Keep in mind: I am NOT a morning person.<br/>I snapped this picture along with a few others that were just as beautiful. I was by myself on the beach for a little while until an old man came along. The old man stripped down to his bathing suit at around 7 a.m. and dove into the water. He swam the beach for a good 30-45 minutes and then got out, dried off, and then left. That was it. No one was there to see him except me.I&apos;ll always remember the old man swimming early in the morning because I would&apos;ve never seen him if I went back to bed. <br/>Sometimes when you wake up early and feel awake, don&apos;t lie around and do nothing. Switch it up and go outside and experience a sunrise by yourself.<br/>@joe_delvicario</p>]]></content:encoded>
